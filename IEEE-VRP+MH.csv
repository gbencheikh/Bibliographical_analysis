The implementation of these algorithms plays a crucial role in achieving favorable outcomes with the available resources. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been a central topic in distribution and logistics for decades. New VRP models and tools are developed to address the challenges of modern logistics. The Energy Minimizing Vehicle Routing Problem (EMVRP) is a “green”-oriented variant of the VRP where the objective is to minimize the total amount of energy consumed by a fleet of vehicles. The VRP literature has focused on solving the problem using a variety of approaches and techniques, including exact methods, heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid algorithms. Hybrid algorithms combine different techniques to obtain more effective and better solutions. This work presents four innovative hybrid algorithms to address the EMVRP problem. These algorithms combine Machine Learning (ML) clustering techniques with metaheuristic approaches inspired by an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed algorithms are: Free Ant + K-Means, Free Ant + K-Medoids, Restricted Ant + K-Means, and Restricted Ant + K-Medoids. Each of them combines the benefits of clustering with the optimization capacity of ACO. Proposed algorithms were subjected to testing using instances from CVRPLIB. Both Free Ant and Restricted Ant efficiently solved EMVRP problems. The results obtained were analyzed and compared with the proposals of other authors in the literature. Overall, the results are promising, but they also indicate a significant scope for experimentation and parameter tuning of the proposed algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3325787","Universidad de Playa Ancha(grant numbers:DGI APFON 03-22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287329","Complex problems;free ant;green-vrp;heuristics;k-means;k-medoids;machine learning;metaheuristics;restricted ant;vehicle routing problem (VRP)","Clustering algorithms;Vehicle routing;Metaheuristics;Machine learning algorithms;Urban areas;Costs;Logistics;Ant colony optimization;Vehicle routing;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning","","","","20","CCBYNCND","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A distinctive feature of the presented survey is its focus on new versions of the VRP, which have recently emerged or gained momentum, and the corresponding new solution methods, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence (CI) approaches. The list of newly proposed or currently popular VRP formulations include last mile and same day delivery, crowdshipping, bike sharing systems, post-disaster response plans, local routing in large production or cargo plants, customer-centric VRP, autonomous delivery, unnamed aerial vehicle delivery, green VRP, waste collection VRP, rich VRP, or VRP with backhauls. Simultaneously, an adequate increase of interest in the application of traditional CI methods (e.g., genetic, memetic, ant colony or particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, or their various hybrid versions) can be observed in the VRP domain. At the same time, approaches proven efficient in other optimization areas (e.g., hyperheuristics, methods based on Monte Carlo simulations, algorithms rooted in game theory and bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games, or cognitively motivated methods) have lately entered the VRP field and become a viable alternative to more traditional techniques. Since VRP is one of the fastest growing fields in the operations research area, we believe that an analysis of the recently published VRP papers from the perspective of their novelty in problem formulation and/or applied solution method can provide a true value for the CI community, especially young researchers entering the field and seeking challenges in this interesting and fast developing research area.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2018.2886585","Narodowe Centrum Nauki(grant numbers:2017/25/B/ST6/02061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591961","Computational intelligence;vehicle routing;combinatorial optimization;metaheuristics","Loading;Vehicle routing;Vehicle dynamics;Computational intelligence;Routing;Transportation;Optimization","","38","","156","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution of 2E-VRP, this study finds a breakthrough that the structure of the optimal route planning for 2E-VRP is usually an embedded Hamiltonian graph. In the graph, routes can be drawn in a planar graph as Hamiltonian circuits without intersections. Based on this finding, an embedded Hamiltonian graph-guided heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve 2E-VRP. As a crucial part of the algorithm, an initialization scheme is designed to search for the farthest vertices from each route and insert the rest of the vertices. In the satellite-adjustment process, a dynamic adjustment for satellites scheme is proposed to adjust the state of satellites. The two schemes aim to construct Hamiltonian circuits with few intersections. Experiments have been conducted on 207 instances to demonstrate the effect of the proposed algorithm on solving 2E-VRP. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more solutions of 2E-VRP with significantly smaller objective-function values. Furthermore, the number of intersections in routes generated by the proposed algorithm is much less than those obtained by the compared algorithms.

DVRP is a challenging variation of the classic vehicle routing problem in which some customers are not known in advance. The objective is to incorporate new customers into the schedule as they become known while still attempting to minimize the cost of serving all customers without violating the problem constraints. This work proposes an effective population-based approach that integrates various algorithmic components to address DVRP. The approach combines a local search algorithm with various evolutionary operators (crossover and mutation) in an adaptive manner. To promote diversity, the proposed approach utilizes a population of solutions and uses a quality-and-diversity strategy to retain only promising solutions. The well-known 21 DVRP benchmark instances are utilized to test the performance of the proposed approach. An experimental comparison is carried out to assess the contribution of the integrated components. Results demonstrate that the integrated components significantly improve search performance. It is also shown that the proposed approach produces new best results for several instances when compared with the best methods reported in the literature. Note to Practitioners—This work deals with dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRPs). In DVRP, only limited information is available at the start, and new information is revealed over time.

We present a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to address the integrated use of UAVs and mobile charging stations and define the VRP with synchronized networks (VRPSN), a new class of VRPs involving the routing of UAVs whose recharge platforms can travel to different locations during an operation. This leads to two networks within the VRP that must be integrated and synchronized.

In transportation systems, when ACO is applied to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP), the path of each ant is only “part” of a feasible solution. In other words, multiple ants' paths may constitute one feasible solution. Previous works mainly focus on the algorithm itself, such as revising the pheromone updating scheme and combining ACO with other optimization methods. However, this body of literature ignores the important procedure of constructing feasible solutions with those “parts”. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a novel ACO algorithm (called AMR) to solve the VRP. The proposed algorithm allows ants to go in and out the depots more than once until they have visited all customers, which simplifies the procedure of constructing feasible solutions. To further enhance AMR, we propose two extensions (AMR-SA and AMR-SA-II) by integrating AMR with other saving algorithms. The computational results for standard benchmark problems are reported and compared with those from other ACO methods. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing ACO algorithms.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2542264","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61402086); Scientific Research Foundation of Liaoning Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:L2015165); Fund for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71110107024); DUFE Excellent Talents Project(grant numbers:DUFE2015R06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462285","Ant colony optimization (ACO);vehicle routing problem (VRP);paths;feasible solutions;saving algorithm","Vehicles;Ant colony optimization;Vehicle routing;Optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms","","78","","52","IEEE","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce transport cost and fuel emissions, a new element of ground-based delivery services, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), is included in the E-grocery distribution system for improving delivery efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study is to optimize a two-echelon distribution network for efficient E-grocery delivery, where conventional vans serve the delivery in the first echelon and ADVs serve delivery in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with mixed vehicles (2E-VRP-MV) with a nonlinear objective function, in which the total transport and emission costs are optimized. This optimization is based on the flow assignment at each echelon and to realize routing choice for both the van and ADV. A two-step clustering-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (C-GA-PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. First, the end customers are clustered to the intermediate depots, named satellites, based on the minimized distance and maximized demand. To enhance the efficiency of resolving the 2E-VRP-MV-model, a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm is adopted to solve the vehicle routing problem. Computational results of up to 21, 32, 50, and 100 customers show the effectiveness of the methods developed here.

Such a problem involves the interplay among the operations that leads to NP-hard problems with complex constraints. Hence, existing methods for AGH are usually designed with massive domain knowledge but still fail to yield high-quality solutions efficiently. In this paper, we aim to enhance the solution quality and computation efficiency for solving AGH. Particularly, we first model AGH as a multiple-fleet vehicle routing problem (VRP) with miscellaneous constraints including precedence, time windows, and capacity. Then we propose a construction framework that decomposes AGH into sub-problems (i.e., VRPs) in fleets and present a neural method to construct the routing solutions to these sub-problems. In specific, we resort to deep learning and parameterize the construction heuristic policy with an attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction heuristics and the specialized methods for AGH. Besides, we empirically verify that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of flights or varying parameters, and can be readily adapted to solve real-time AGH with stochastic flight arrivals.

This problem calls for the minimization of the transportation distance required for the delivery of the items which are demanded by the clients, carried out by a fleet of electric vehicles in several depots. Since the 2L-MDEVRP is an NP-hard problem, a heuristic algorithm combined variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS) and space saving heuristic algorithm (SSH) is proposed. The VNS algorithm is used to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP) sub-problem, and the SSH algorithm is used to solve the bin packing problem (BPP) sub-problem. We propose the space saving heuristic to find the best matching solution between the next loading item and the feasible loading position. The SSH-VNS algorithm is tested by using benchmark instances available from the literature. The results show that the SSH-VNS algorithm has better performance compared with other published results for solving capacity vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and two-dimensional capacity vehicle routing problem (2L-CVRP). Some new best-known solutions of the benchmark problem are also found by SSH-VNS. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on 2L-MDEVRP is demonstrated through numerical experiments and a practical logistic distribution case. In the last section, the managerial implications and suggestions for future research are also discussed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971220","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71602008,71802021,71801013,71803029); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:9184023); Beijing Social Science Fund(grant numbers:16JDGLC032,17JDGLB011,18GLB022); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:FRF-OT-18-012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979417","Vehicle routing problem;two-dimensional loading;electric vehicle;variable neighborhood search;space saving heuristic","Electric vehicles;Loading;Routing;Mathematical model;Batteries;Vehicle routing;Logistics","","31","","28","CCBY","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It includes multiple nonfixed depots and emergency trips from patients to the closest depot. The aim is to minimize the system's delayed latency by satisfying mandatory visit times. Delayed latency corresponds to caregivers' total overtime hours worked while visiting patients. A new mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to address this problem. Computational experiments, with more than 165 new benchmark instances, are carried out using the CPLEX and Gurobi MIP solvers. The results indicate that patients' geographical distribution directly impacts the complexity of the problem. An analysis of the model parameters proves that instances with more depots/vehicles or longer workdays are significantly easier to solve than are original cases. The results show that Gurobi outperforms CPLEX in 55% of the instances analyzed, while CPLEX performs better in only 16% of them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VRP that minimizes delayed latency and the first HHC routing study to use a cumulative objective function.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058242","Universidad del Bío-Bío, through the Project Algoritmos Exactos y Metaheurísticos Para Nuevas Variantes Del Problema de Ruteo de Vehículos(grant numbers:2060222 IF/R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350647","CCVRP;home health care;HHC;MDCCVRP;mixed integer programming","Routing;Vehicle routing;Hospitals;Biological system modeling;Synchronization;Logistics;Industrial engineering","","11","","69","CCBYNCND","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Fast Decomposition and Reconstruction Framework for the Pickup and Delivery Problem With Time Windows and LIFO Loading","F. Liu; M. Gui; C. Yi; Y.

Due to its NP-hard nature, it is difficult for exact algorithms and heuristics with a linear structure to solve a large-scale problem in a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose a fast decomposition and reconstruction framework (D&R) to solve the PDPTWL with high quality in a relatively short time. An angle-based sweep method is used to decompose a complete solution into multiple sub-solutions, each of which is assigned to a tabu search for optimization. To speed up the whole process, the optimization procedure of sub-solutions is performed by different processors of multi-core CPU in parallel. Three neighborhood operators and three strategies to reduce the number of vehicles are designed to cope with the tabu search for further improvement. Moreover, the adaptive memory mechanism is added to provide a better start when the optimization procedure falls into the local optima. We compare our framework against the best known solutions on 119 instances with up to 300 requests, the results show that our framework is able to improve over 85% (107 out of 119) of the best known solutions. More specifically, the number of vehicles is optimized by about 60% (74 out of 119) and the driving distance by about 50% (59 out of 119). In addition on instances with the largest size of requests, the computational time of our framework can be 1/50 of the comparative results, confirming its efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920444","Engineering and Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Logistics Supply Chain and Internet of Things(grant numbers:GDDST[2016]176); Key Laboratory of Cloud Computing for Super—Integration Cloud Computing in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:610245048129); Engineering and Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Big Data Intelligent Processing(grant numbers:GDDST[2013]1513-1-11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727877","Pickup and delivery problem with time windows;LIFO loading;tabu search;adaptive memory","Optimization;Microsoft Windows;Transportation;Loading;Logistics;Heuristic algorithms;Germanium","","8","","43","OAPA","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are many algorithms to solve the CVRP to minimize total travelled distance. Some of the most recent and efficient metaheuristic algorithms are capable of generating solutions within 0.5% to 1% gap from the optimum for instance problems adopted from the literature considering hundreds or thousands of demand points. In this contribution, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed based on Gravitational Emulation Local Search (GELS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This algorithm alleviates the weaknesses of the GELS algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm, which is called GELSGA, is compared with other meta-heuristics. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm can compete vigorously with them. In addition, the proposed algorithm could obtain solutions close to the Best Known Solutions (BKS) for many instance problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924710","Capacitated vehicle routing problem;hybrid algorithm;genetic algorithm;gravitational emulation local search;optimization","Vehicle routing;Genetic algorithms;Search problems;Optimization;Clustering algorithms;Logistics;Emulation","","22","","65","CCBY","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
