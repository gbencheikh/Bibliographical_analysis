We introduce the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (E-VRPTW), which incorporates the possibility of recharging at any of the available stations using an appropriate recharging scheme. Furthermore, we consider limited vehicle freight capacities as well as customer time windows, which are the most important constraints in real-world logistics applications. As a solution method, we present a hybrid heuristic that combines a variable neighborhood search algorithm with a tabu search heuristic.

The purpose of this article is to investigate how alternative fuel infrastructure and patterns of customer locations influence fleet compositions when minimizing routing costs. The variable-route vehicle refueling problem (VRVRP) for the mixed fleet is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and solved with an optimization method. A logistic regression is then employed to assess the impacts of both the density of the alternative fuel infrastructure and the patterns of customer locations on the optimal fleet composition. Experimental results reveal that the right fleet mix decision is impacted by customer location patterns and available fuel infrastructure. While alternative fuel trucks were favored over conventional trucks with a dense alternative fuel infrastructure, the likelihood of mixed fleet use varied across different patterns of customer demand locations. Further, our analysis suggests that shippers and trucking carriers should understand the relative benefits and constraints of different geographical dispersions of customers and densities of alternative fuel infrastructures when designing optimal delivery strategies.","2015","2024-04-22 18:39:24","2024-04-22 18:39:24","2024-04-22","409-437","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: Penn State University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vehicle routing problem with soft time windows has a lexicographic objective function, aimed at minimizing first the number of routes, then the number of violated time windows, and finally the total routing distance. We present a multistage very large-scale neighborhood search for this problem. Each stage corresponds to a variable neighborhood descent over a parameterizable very large-scale neighborhood. These neighborhoods contain an exponential number of neighbors, as opposed to classical local search neighborhoods. Often, searching very large-scale neighborhoods can produce local optima of a higher quality than polynomial-sized neighborhoods can. Furthermore, we use a sophisticated heuristic to determine service start times allowing us to minimize the number of violated time windows. We test our approach on a number of different problem types, and compare the results to the relevant state of the art. The experimental results show that our algorithm improves best known solutions on 53% of the most studied instances.

Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one.

When the sum of profits is maximized under distance constraints, the problem is usually called the team orienteering problem. The capacitated profitable tour problem seeks to maximize profits minus travel costs under capacity constraints. Finally, in the VRP with a private fleet and common carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subject to a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customer's selection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route. We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems, which explores an exponential number of solutions in pseudo-polynomial time. The search is conducted with standard VRP neighborhoods on an exhaustive solution representation, visiting all customers. Since visiting all customers is usually infeasible or suboptimal, an efficient select algorithm, based on resource constrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used on any new route to find the optimal subsequence of visits to customers. The good performance of these neighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experiments with a local search, an iterated local search, and a hybrid genetic algorithm. Intriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum of this neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0.09% on classic team orienteering benchmark instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics. Promising research avenues on hybridizations with more standard routing neighborhoods are also open.","2016","2024-04-22 18:39:49","2024-04-22 18:39:49","2024-04-22","720-734","","2","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, operates such a program in India for about 1.3 million children in more than 9,000 schools in nine states. The foundation faced a logistics problem in efficiently distributing food within the available time window. This paper discusses the challenges it faced, how we used OR modeling to overcome them, and how we designed, developed, and implemented a software solution. To address the logistics problem, we proposed a three-stage decomposition heuristic solution, which consists of clustering schools, assigning appropriate distribution vehicles to clusters, and routing vehicles within the clusters. We implemented our solution, AMRUTA, on a pilot basis in one location. Based on this pilot, the projected annual cost savings are US$75,000, which would enable the foundation to add 2,400 more children. When the program is fully implemented, we estimate that the annual cost savings will be about US$1.96 million.

In this paper, we present a solution to the energy-efficient routing problem for electric vehicles using ant colony optimization.

The completely new application of a hyper-heuristic as an analysis tool offers promising perspectives for supporting dedicated heuristic development. The experimental results reveal that different low-level heuristics perform better on different problems and that their performance varies during a search process.

In this paper, we quantify the benefit of using split loads for the pickup and delivery problem. A heuristic to solve the pickup and delivery problem with split loads is developed and applied to a set of random large-scale problem instances, revealing the potential benefit of split loads. This benefit is reduced when the heuristic is applied to a real-world trucking industry problem because of several problem instance characteristics. The benefit of split loads is found to be most closely tied to three characteristics: load size, cost associated with a pickup or delivery, and the frequency with which loads have origins or destinations in common.

The service operation addressed here differs from delivery operations in that a vehicle has to stop for extended periods of time while its driver serves customers. We discuss measuring the impact of AFV adoption on fleet operations from multiple perspectives and formulate four objective functions to represent the defined performance metrics in a generalized mixed-integer linear programming model. The model can accommodate various AFV types with respect to driving range, refueling time, and availability of refueling stations. We develop a variable neighborhood search heuristic to solve large-scale problems efficiently. Results from the research show that the classical vehicle routing objective of minimizing total vehicle miles traveled does not work well in this emerging problem; instead, an objective such as minimizing carbon emissions or fuel costs provides more desirable solutions. The results also show that in service fleets, refueling time has lesser impact on fleet performance compared to service station availability or vehicle range. From a managerial standpoint, this indicates that investment in range extension or establishing service stations is more important than investment in faster refueling capability.","2017","2024-04-22 18:40:24","2024-04-22 18:40:24","2024-04-22","480-493","","2","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is aimed at determining the optimal vehicle routes for satisfying customer demand. Regarding the packing aspects, transported boxes are not directly loaded into the vehicle-loading spaces; instead, they are feasibly stacked into pallets that are then loaded onto the vehicles before initiating their tours. Belonging to the class of combined routing and packing models, PPVRP is very hard to be optimally solved within manageable computational time; thus, we focused on heuristic approaches for both the routing and packing aspects of the problem. More specifically, PPVRP is solved via a local search metaheuristic strategy based on the regional aspiration criteria of tabu search.

The aim is to locate a set of urban distribution centers (UDCs) and to connect them via a ring in which massive flows of goods will circulate. Goods are transported from gates located outside the city to a UDC, and either join a second UDC through the ring before being delivered in electric vans to the final customers or are delivered directly to the customers from the first UDC. The reverse trip with pickup and transportation to the gates is also possible. A delivery service path starts at a particular UDC, then visits a subset of customers and ends at the same UDC, another UDC, or a self-service parking lot (SPL). A pickup route can start from an SPL or a UDC and ends at a UDC. The objective is to minimize the sum of the installation costs of the ring, flow transportation costs, and routing costs. The MRLRP belongs to the class of location-routing problems (LRP). We model it with a set-partitioning-like representation of delivery and pickup trips and arc-flow elements to describe goods transportation in the ring and between the ring and the gates. We present three approaches to solving the MRLRP: an exact method for small-size instances, a matheuristic for instances of a larger size, and a hybrid approach that applies the exact method to the columns output by the matheuristic. Numerical results are provided for an exhaustive set of instances, obtained by extending benchmark instances of the capacitated LRP with additional MRLRP features.","2016","2024-04-22 18:40:25","2024-04-22 18:40:25","2024-04-22","541-558","","2","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our algorithm employs an advanced neighborhood, called the cyclic-exchange neighborhood, in addition to standard neighborhoods for the vehicle routing problem. After fixing the order of customers for a vehicle to visit, we must determine the optimal start times of processing at customers so that the total penalty is minimized.

These problems have many real-world applications, including beverage distribution, courier service transportation, and reverse logistics. We first concentrate on a well-studied problem in this class, known as the single vehicle routing problem with deliveries and selective pickups (SVRPDSP), in which deliveries are mandatory but pickups are optional and generate a revenue if performed, and customers requiring both a delivery and a pickup (combined demand) can be visited either once or twice. Most exact algorithms in the literature solve SVRPDSP by looking for elementary tours on an extended network that is obtained by transforming each combined demand cus tomer into two different customers, one requiring only the delivery and the other one only the pickup. Because this can result in a significant loss in performance, in this work we focus instead on the original problem network and present formulations that can yield non-elementary tours. Through the use of Benders decomposition, valid inequalities, and tailored optimization techniques based on branch-and-cut frameworks, we develop exact algorithms that outmatch previous results in the literature and obtain proven optimal solutions for all benchmark instances.

We propose an integrated approach that jointly addresses: (i) the assignment of operators to patients so as to guarantee the compatibility between skills associated with operators and patient visits; (ii) the scheduling of the visits in a given planning horizon; and (iii) the determination of the operator tours in every day of the planning horizon. The main home care problem we investigate refers to providers dedicated to palliative care and terminal patients. In this context, balancing objective functions are particularly relevant. Therefore, two balancing functions are studied, i.e., maxmin, which maximizes the minimum operator utilization factor, and minmax, which minimizes the maximum operator utilization factor. In both cases, the concept of pattern is introduced as a key tool to jointly address assignment, scheduling, and routing decisions, where a pattern specifies a possible schedule for skilled visits. The approach we propose is, however, able to cope with peculiarities from other home care contexts. Model extensions to handle scenarios other than the palliative one are discussed in the paper. Extensive computational results are reported both on palliative home care instances based on real data, and on two real-world data sets from the literature, related to contexts very different from the palliative one. For both data sets the proposed approach is able to find solutions of good quality. In the palliative context, the results show that the selection of the pattern generation policy is crucial to solve large instances efficiently. Furthermore, the maxmin criterion is able to return more balanced solutions; i.e., the difference between the maximum and the minimum operator utilization factors is very small. On the other hand, the minmax criterion is more suitable for minimizing the operating costs, since it computes solutions with smaller total traveled time.","2015","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22","830-852","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider four variants of the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows: (i) at most a single recharge per route is allowed, and batteries are fully recharged on visit of a recharging station; (ii) multiple recharges per route, full recharges only; (iii) at most a single recharge per route, and partial battery recharges are possible; and (iv) multiple, partial recharges. For each variant, we present exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms that rely on customized monodirectional and bidirectional labeling algorithms for generating feasible vehicle routes. In computational studies, we find that all four variants are solvable for instances with up to 100 customers and 21 recharging stations. This success can be attributed to the tailored resource extension functions (REFs) that enable efficient labeling with constant time feasibility checking and strong dominance rules, even if these REFs are intricate and rather elaborate to derive. The studies also highlight the superiority of the bidirectional labeling algorithms compared to the monodirectional ones.

Therefore, before serving the customers, it is necessary to detach the trailer in an appropriate parking place (called either a satellite depot or a trailer point) and transfer goods between the truck and the trailer. This problem has applications in milk collection for farms that cannot be reached using large vehicles. In this work we present an integer programming formulation of the STTRPSD.

Efforts to detect and eradicate invading populations before they establish are a critical component of national biosecurity programmes. An essential element for maximizing the efficiency of these efforts is the balancing of expenditures on surveillance (e.g. trapping) versus treatment (e.g. eradication). Identifying the optimal allocation of resources towards surveillance requires an underlying model of how costs and the probability of detection fluctuate with survey intensity across various landscapes. Here, we develop a model, widely applicable across biological systems, for predicating costs associated with varying surveillance intensities across diverse road networks. 2. We assumed that surveillance is conducted across a set of point locations. Resources needed to conduct surveillance include the fixed costs associated with surveying a point (e.g. cost of materials or labour time spent at the survey point) and variable costs that correspond to the expense of the time and distance travelled between points. We estimated travel time and distance between points as functions of surveillance intensity and road network characteristics using data from simulated least cost driving routes connecting points located on real-world road networks. Time and distance estimates were then combined with cost data from an actual gypsy moth Lymantria dispar surveillance programme in the state of Washington to predict per trap costs of surveillance across varying road network densities and surveillance intensities. 3. Per point driving time, driving distance and total costs all decline with increasing survey point density and increasing road density. Surveillance intensity (planned point spacing) explains ~94% of the average time driven per point and 97% of the distance driven per point &#x2014; thus representing the primary explanatory variable. Incorporating road density and dead end road density explains relatively little additional variance in the model, although they improve goodness of fit. 4. Synthesis and applications. This work predicts costs associated with surveillance of invasive species populations. We find that the cost per survey point diminishes with increasing survey point density and also depends on road network characteristics. When combined with maps for the relative risk of alien species establishment across landscapes and measures of surveillance efficacy dependent on effort, these cost predictions can increase efficiency of surveillance and eradication efforts for the gypsy moth and other invasive species.","2017","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22","225-233","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: [British Ecological Society, Wiley]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this complex interdependent problem of vehicle routing and break scheduling, we propose a restricted dynamic programming heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and the full European social legislation on drivers' driving and working hours. The problem we consider includes all rules in this legislation, whereas in the literature only a basic set of rules has been addressed. In addition to this basic set of rules, the legislation contains a set of modifications that allow for more flexibility. To include the legislation in the restricted dynamic programming heuristic, we propose a break scheduling heuristic. Computational results show that our method finds solutions to benchmark instances—which only consider the basic set of rules—with 18% fewer vehicles and 5% less travel distance than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our results are obtained with significantly less computational effort. Furthermore, the results show that including a set of rules on drivers' working hours—which has been generally ignored in the literature—has a significant impact on the resulting vehicle schedules: 3.9% more vehicle routes and 1.0% more travel distances are needed. Finally, using the modified rules of the legislation leads to an additional reduction of 4% in the number of vehicles and of 1.5% in travel distances. Therefore, the modified rules should be exploited in practice.]","2010","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22 18:40:39","2024-04-22","442-454","","4","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The APVRP covers a range of logistics applications where pickup-and-delivery requests necessitate a joint operation of active vehicles (e.g., trucks) and passive vehicles (e.g., loading devices such as containers or swap bodies). The objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the total distance traveled, the total completion time of the routes, and the number of unserved requests. To this end, the problem supports a flexible coupling and decoupling of active and passive vehicles at customer locations. Accordingly, the operations of the vehicles have to be synchronized carefully in the planning. The contribution of the paper is twofold: First, we present an exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for this class of routing problems with synchronization constraints. To our knowledge, this algorithm is the first such approach that considers explicitly the temporal interdependencies between active and passive vehicles. The algorithm is based on a nontrivial network representation that models the logical relationships between the different transport tasks necessary to fulfill a request as well as the synchronization of the movements of active and passive vehicles. Second, we contribute to the development of branch-and-price methods in general, in that we solve, for the first time, an ng-path relaxation of a pricing problem with linear vertex costs by means of a bidirectional labeling algorithm. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm delivers improved bounds and solutions for a number of APVRP benchmark instances.

A single bus is assigned to each route, picking up students and arriving at the school within a specified time window. SBRP aims to find the fewest buses needed to cover all of the routes while minimizing the total travel distance and meeting required constraints. We propose a mathematical formulation responding to the overbooking policies applied in a real-world school district. According to our empirical studies, the probability of a student riding a bus varies from 22% to 77%, opening the opportunity to overbook the buses to improve utilization of their capacity. However, SBRP with overbooking has not attracted much attention in previous studies. In this work, overbooking is modeled via chance constrained programming. Additionally, to account for the uncertainty of the total travel time of the buses, a constraint limiting the probability of being late to school is also proposed in this paper. As a result of the NP-hard nature of the problem, a cascade simplification algorithm is proposed to partition the multiple stage SBRP problems into multiple multi-depot and one-school subproblems that are solved sequentially, where the results for one are data inputs for the next.

Consequently, a high percentage of time-definite deliveries, as common in the small package shipping sector, should have a significant negative effect on the solution quality of TBRAs. To the best of our knowledge, no study exists on the magnitude of this effect and the factors that influence it. Therefore, we develop a two-phase TBRA and use it (i) to investigate the design requirements of a TBRA for successfully handling time windows, and (ii) to study the influence of time window constraints on the performance of such an approach. We find that the consideration of geographical aspects in the districting is paramount for generating high-quality territories, whereas explicitly incorporating time window characteristics and historical demand data does not lead to a perceptible improvement of the solution quality. Moreover, the efficiency and feasibility forfeits of our TBRA in comparison to daily route reoptimization (RR) are larger if time windows are present. However, significantly higher consistency improvements compared to RR are achieved for time-constrained problems. This is due to the fact that RR solutions to time-definite problems exhibit lower consistency and thus a higher potential for improvement by using a TBRA, which constitutes an important insight for practitioners.","2015","2024-04-22 18:40:40","2024-04-22 18:40:40","2024-04-22","732-751","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The location-routing problem (LRP) overcomes this drawback by simultaneously tackling location and routing decisions. This paper presents a cooperative metaheuristic to solve the LRP with capacitated routes and depots. The principle is to alternate between a depot location phase and a routing phase, exchanging information on the most promising edges. In the first phase, the routes and their customers are aggregated into supercustomers, leading to a facility-location problem, which is then solved by a Lagrangean relaxation of the assignment constraints. In the second phase, the routes from the resulting multidepot vehicle-routing problem (VRP) are improved using a granular tabu search (GTS) heuristic. At the end of each global iteration, information about the edges most often used is recorded to be used in the following phases.

Examination of the VRP literature indicates that the min-max VRP has received less attention than other variants have over the years. However, the problem has important practical applications, such as those related to routing school buses. In this setting, in addition to the min-max criterion imposed on the time it takes to complete the longest route, school districts are concerned with the minimization of the total distance traveled, which is the objective of the classical VRP. Hence, the problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization model that trades off service (i.e., the minimization of the longest route) and operational cost (i.e., the minimization of the total distance traveled). We develop a solution procedure for this problem by applying tabu search within the framework of Multiobjective Adaptive Memory Programming and compare it to an implementation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm&#x2014;a wellknown approach to multiobjective optimization.

These requirements may be too restrictive in some applications. In the generalized ConVRP (GenConVRP), each customer is visited by a limited number of drivers and the variation in the arrival times is penalized in the objective function. The vehicle departure times may be adjusted to obtain stable arrival times. Additionally, customers are associated with AM/PM time windows. In contrast to previous work on the ConVRP, we do not use the template concept to generate routing plans. Our approach is based on a flexible large neighborhood search that is applied to the entire solution. Several destroy and repair heuristics have been designed to remove customers from the routes and to reinsert them at better positions. Arrival time consistency is improved by a simple 2-opt operator that reverses parts of particular routes. A computational study is performed on ConVRP benchmark instances and on new instances generated for the generalized problem. The proposed algorithm performs well on different variants of the ConVRP. It outperforms template-based approaches in terms of travel cost and time consistency. For the GenConVRP, we experiment with different input parameters and examine the trade-off between travel cost and customer satisfaction. Remarkable cost savings can be obtained by allowing more than one driver per customer.","2015","2024-04-22 18:41:08","2024-04-22 18:41:08","2024-04-22","796-816","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are multiple decision makers in this problem: the public sector as the service provider and the collection of individual households that make their own routing decisions to perform a given set of out-of-home activities together with a visit to a refueling location. A solution method that does not require the full information of the coverage matrix is developed to reduce the computational burden.

In their efforts to increase road safety and improve working conditions of truck drivers, governments worldwide are enforcing stricter limits on the amount of working and driving time without rest. This paper describes an effective optimization algorithm for minimizing transportation costs for a fleet of vehicles considering business hours of customers and hours of service regulations. The algorithm combines the exploration capacities of population-based metaheuristics, the quick improvement abilities of local search, with forward labeling procedures for checking compliance with complex hours of service regulations. Several speedup techniques are proposed to achieve an overall efficient approach. The proposed approach is used to assess the impact of different hours of service regulations from a carrier-centric point of view. Extensive computational experiments for various sets of regulations in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Australia are conducted to provide an international assessment of the impact of different rules on transportation costs and accident risks. Our experiments demonstrate that European Union rules lead to the highest safety, whereas Canadian regulations are the most competitive in terms of economic efficiency. Australian regulations appear to have unnecessarily high risk rates with respect to operating costs. The recent rule change in the United States reduces accident risk rates with a moderate increase in operating costs.","2014","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","391-412","","3","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, a higher service frequency leads to higher routing costs, but at the same time less or smaller bins are required, which leads to lower bin allocation investment costs. The bins used have different types and different costs and there is a limit on the space at each collection site as well as a limit on the total number of bins of each type that can be used. In this paper we consider the problem of designing a collection system consisting of the combination of a vehicle routing and a bin allocation problem in which the trade-off between the associated costs has to be considered. The solution approach combines an effective variable neighborhood search metaheuristic for the routing part with a mixed integer linear programming-based exact method for the solution of the bin allocation part.

Equity concerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the utilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported in the literature. However, there has been only limited discussion about how workload equity should be modeled in the context of VRPs, and various measures for optimizing such objectives have been proposed and implemented without a critical evaluation of their respective merits and consequences. This article addresses this gap by providing an analysis of classical and alternative equity functions for biobjective VRP models. In our survey, we review and categorize the existing literature on equitable VRPs. In the analysis, we identify a set of axiomatic properties that an ideal equity measure should satisfy, collect six common measures of equity, and point out important connections between their properties and the properties of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions. To gauge the extent of these implications, we also conduct a numerical study on small biobjective VRP instances solvable to optimality. Our study reveals two undesirable consequences when optimizing equity with nonmonotonic functions: Pareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all tours are TSP optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be workload inconsistent, i.e., composed of tours whose workloads are all equal to or longer than those of other Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that the extent of these phenomena should not be underestimated. The results of our biobjective analysis remain valid also for weighted sum, constraint-based, or single-objective models. Based on this analysis, we conclude that monotonic equity functions are more appropriate for certain types of VRP models, and suggest promising avenues for further research on equity in logistics.]","2018","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","239-260","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using memory structures, bidirectional dynamic programming, and lower bounds, we show that a large neighborhood involving classical moves on the sequences of services along with optimal orientation decisions can be searched in amortized O(1) time per move evaluation instead of O(n) as in previous works. Because of its generality and now-reduced complexity, this approach can be efficiently applied to several variants of arc routing problems, extended into large neighborhoods such as ejection chains, and integrated into two classical metaheuristics. Our computational experiments lead to solutions of high quality on the main benchmark sets for the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), the mixed capacitated general routing problem (MCGRP), the periodic CARP, the multidepot CARP, and the min-max k-vehicles windy rural postman problem, with a total of 1,528 instances. We also report sensitivity analyses for new MCGRP instances with turn penalties, which are uncommonly challenging yet critical for many practical applications.]","2017","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","992-1010","","4","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its trucks deliver container loads from a port to import customers and collect container loads from export customers to the same port. In this case study, all import customers in a route must be serviced before all export customers, each customer can be visited more than once and containers are never unloaded or reloaded from the truck chassis along any route. We model the problem using an Integer Linear Programming formulation and propose an Adaptive Guidance metaheuristic. Our extensive computational experiments show that the adaptive guidance algorithm is capable of determining good-quality solutions in many instances of practical or potential interest for the carrier within 10 min of computing time, whereas the mathematical formulation often fails to provide the first feasible solution within 3 h of computing time.","2015","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","1222-1236","","7","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: [Operational Research Society, Palgrave Macmillan Journals]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, effectively managing a workforce of drivers may increase travel distance, a traditional metric of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). This paper evaluates the effect that workforce management has on routing costs, providing insight for managerial decision making. The analysis is presented in the context of the period vehicle routing problem (PVRP), an extension of the VRP with vehicle routes constructed to service customers according to preset visit frequencies over an established period of time. We develop models to apply workforce management principles. Through a computational study with standard PVRP test cases and real-world delivery data, we show that multiobjective PVRP models can achieve a balance between workforce management and travel distance goals. With the proper parameters in place, workforce management principles may be successfully applied without sacrificing other operational objectives.","2013","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","214-230","","2","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the necessary dynamic programming algorithm for the solution evaluation is very time consuming, considered candidate solutions are stored in the solution archive. It acts as complete memory of the search history, avoids reevaluations of duplicate solution candidates, and is able to efficiently transform them into guaranteed new ones. This increases the diversity of the population and reduces the risk of premature convergence. Similar to a branch-and-bound algorithm, the tree structure of the solution archive is further exploited to compute lower bounds on the nodes to cut off parts of the solution space that evidently do not contain good solutions. Since in each iteration a not yet considered solution candidate is generated and completeness can be efficiently checked, the overall method is in principle an exact enumeration algorithm, which leads to guaranteed optimal solutions for smaller instances. Computational results of this algorithm show the superiority over the so far state-of-theart metaheuristic and also prove its effectiveness on the nongeneralized version of this problem.]","2018","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","673-690","","3","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The requests may be located on nodes, edges, and arcs. The problem has theoretical interest because it is a generalization of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), and the general routing problem. It is also of great practical interest since it is often a more accurate model for real-world cases than its widely studied specializations, particularly for so-called street routing applications. Examples are urban waste collection, snow removal, and newspaper delivery. We propose a new iterated local search metaheuristic for the problem that also includes vital mechanisms from adaptive large neighborhood search combined with further intensification through local search. The method utilizes selected, tailored, and novel local search and large neighborhood search operators, as well as a new local search strategy. Computational experiments show that the proposed metaheuristic is highly effective on five published benchmarks for the MCGRP. The metaheuristic yields excellent results also on seven standard CARP data sets, and good results on four well-known CVRP benchmarks, including improvement of the best known upper bound for one instance.","2016","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","1223-1238","","4","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A vital part of this refueling process is the individual tanker crew. Constrained by the number of tanker crews available, the United States Air Force must find ways to efficiently schedule them. This paper discusses an effective hybrid tabu search/set partitioning approach to Air Mobility Command's tanker crew scheduling problem. This hybrid approach combines the metaheuristic tabu search with a classical optimization approach. A novel, dynamic, neighborhood-based vocabulary scheme is developed to exploit a set-partition based optimizer. The results show that the hybrid approach significantly outperforms the tabu search alone. The robustness of the developed approach is judged with testing using designed experiments. Finally, an integer program (IP) is developed to calculate lower bounds for the tanker crew scheduling problem objectives and to measure the overall quality of solutions produced by the hybrid approach.]","2004","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22 18:41:09","2024-04-22","43-56","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: Military Operations Research Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning (MTPDPTW-MP) that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling. Because of the strict limits on route duration, each ambulance traverses several routes per day, which, starting and terminating at the depot, complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients. A feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints, such as capacity, pickup before delivery, time windows, etc. The objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible, then minimizes the operational cost, and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload. Theoretically, MTPDPTW-MP, which is a combination of two well known NP-hard problems (i.e., the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem), is difficult to solve. In this study, we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase. We use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions; a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff. To speed up the process, we adapt the segment-based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real-world instances. Results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a simplified problem: the multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows.","2017","2024-04-22 18:41:10","2024-04-22 18:41:10","2024-04-22","688-705","","2","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inventory routing refers to the optimization of transportation costs for the replenishment of customers' inventories: based on consumption forecasts, the vendor organizes delivery routes. Our model takes into account pickups, time windows, drivers' safety regulations, orders, and many other real-life constraints. This generalization of the vehicle-routing problem was often handled in two stages in the past: inventory first, routing second. On the contrary, a characteristic of our local search approach is the absence of decomposition, made possible by a fast volume assignment algorithm. Moreover, thanks to a large variety of randomized neighborhoods, a simple first-improvement descent is used instead of tuned, complex metaheuristics. The problem being solved every day with a rolling horizon, the short-term objective needs to be carefully designed to ensure long-term savings. To achieve this goal, we propose a new surrogate objective function for the short-term model, based on long-term lower bounds. An extensive computational study shows that our solution is effective, efficient, and robust, providing long-term savings exceeding 20% on average, compared to solutions built by expert planners or even a classical urgency-based constructive algorithm. Confirming the promised gains in operations, the resulting decision support system is progressively deployed worldwide.]","2011","2024-04-22 18:41:10","2024-04-22 18:41:10","2024-04-22","381-398","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
