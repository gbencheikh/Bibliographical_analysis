The primary objective is to minimize the overall cost, which encompasses travel expenses, waiting times, recharging costs, and fixed vehicle costs. The focal problem is formulated as a heterogeneous and multi-trip electric vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (H-MT-EVRP-PD). Additionally, we introduce two heuristic algorithms to efficiently approximate solutions within a reasonable computational time. The variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm and the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm are presented and compared based on our computational experiences with both.

In recent years, the electric road system (ERS) has been introduced and piloted in a few countries and regions to decarbonize heavy-duty vehicles. However, little research has been carried out on its reliability. This paper fills the gap and investigates the reliability of electric truck power supply systems for electric road (ETPSS–ER), which considers both the power system and truck traffic networks. First, a brief introduction of electric roads illustrates the working principle of EV charging on roads. Then, an optimized electric truck (ET) travel pattern model is built, based on which the corresponding ET charging load demand, including both static charging and dynamic charging, is conducted. Then, based on the new ET travel pattern model, a daily travel-pattern-driven Monte Carlo simulation-based reliability assessment method for ETPSS–ER system is presented. Case studies based on the IEEE RBTS system shows that ETs driving on ERS systems can meet the daily travel demands. The case studies also examine the impacts of increasing number of ETs, extra wind power, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) on the reliability of ERS power systems.","2024","2024-04-22 19:31:26","2024-04-22 19:31:26","","","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","genetic algorithm; electric trucks; daily route optimization; dynamic charging mode; electric road system; reliability assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study constructs a logistics distribution optimization model for cross-border e-commerce multimodal transportation. The mathematical model aims to minimize distribution costs, minimize carbon emissions during the distribution process, and maximize customer satisfaction as objective functions. It also considers constraints from multiple dimensions, such as cargo aircraft and vehicle load limitations. Meanwhile, corresponding improvement strategies were designed based on the Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm. An improved swarm intelligence algorithm was proposed to develop an optimizer based on the improved swarm intelligence algorithm for model solving. The effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model and improved swarm intelligence algorithm was verified through a real-world case of cross-border e-commerce logistics transportation.

However, it is anticipated that a mixed traffic of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will persist for a considerable period until the Market Penetration Rate reaches 100%. During this phase, AVs and HVs will interact and coexist on the roads. Such an environment can cause unpredictable and dynamic traffic conditions due to HVs, which results in traffic problems including traffic congestion. Therefore, the routes of AVs must be controlled in a mixed traffic environment. This study proposes a multi-objective vehicle routing control method using a deep Q-network to control the driving direction at intersections in a mixed traffic environment. The objective is to distribute the traffic flow and control the routes safely and efficiently to their destination. Simulation results showed that the proposed method outperformed existing methods in terms of the driving distance, time, and waiting time of AVs, particularly in more dynamic traffic environments. Consequently, the traffic became smooth as it moved along optimal routes.","2024","2024-04-22 19:31:26","2024-04-22 19:31:26","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","deep reinforcement learning; autonomous vehicle; deep Q-network; traffic flow; vehicle routing control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, the problem of electric vehicle routing (EVRP) has been widely studied in recent years. This paper deals with an extended version of EVRP, in which electric vehicles (EVs) deliver goods to customers. The limited battery capacity of EVs causes their operational domains to be less than those of gasoline vehicles. For this purpose, several charging stations are considered in this study for EVs. In addition, depending on the operational domain, a full charge may not be needed, which reduces the operation time. Therefore, partial recharging is also taken into account in the present research. This problem is formulated as a multi-objective integer linear programming model, whose objective functions include economic, environmental, and social aspects. Then, the preemptive fuzzy goal programming method (PFGP) is exploited as an exact method to solve small-sized problems. Also, two hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms inspired by nature, including MOSA, MOGWO, MOPSO, and NSGAII_TLBO, are utilized to solve large-sized problems. The results obtained from solving the numerous test problems demonstrate that the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm can provide efficient solutions in terms of quality and non-dominated solutions in all test problems. In addition, the performance of the algorithms was compared in terms of four indexes: time, MID, MOCV, and HV. Moreover, statistical analysis is performed to investigate whether there is a significant difference between the performance of the algorithms. The results indicate that the MOSA algorithm performs better in terms of the time index. On the other hand, the NSGA-II-TLBO algorithm outperforms in terms of the MID, MOCV, and HV indexes.","2024","2024-04-22 19:31:26","2024-04-22 19:31:26","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sustainability; capacitated EVRP; epsilon-constraint; hard and soft time windows; nature-inspired algorithms; partial recharging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the BET dispatching problem is NP-hard, the performance of existing approaches deteriorates in large instance problems, especially when the customers have different preferences and constraints. This article proposes a bi-level strategy that incorporates routing zone partitioning and metaheuristic-based vehicle routing to solve the large-scale BET dispatching problem, considering the delivery types, limited travel distances, and cargo payloads. We apply this strategy to a real-world fleet dispatching scenario with around 300 customer positions for pickups and drop-offs.

The three metaheuristics available in this tool were able to reduce significantly the cost associated with waste collection in less than 2 s of execution time. The result obtained in this work proves the applicability of the OR-Tools to be explored for waste collection problems considering bigger systems.

Given a criterion, the perceived cost is not deterministic for many reasons (congestion, incomplete information on the state of the system, inexact prediction of the system state, etc.). The same consideration applies to the best-chosen route, assuming that the route is an ordered list of network nodes to visit. The paths and routes perceived and chosen (drivers or companies) could follow different criteria (i.e., minizmum congested travel time for the path and minimum monetary cost for the route). In this context, the paths chosen between two pick-up and delivery points, studied with the path choice problem (PCP), influence the best route, studied with the vehicle routing problem (VRP). This paper reports some considerations on the importance of modelling the path choice behavior in the VRP; the influence of the PCP on the VRP is studied. The considerations are supported by a numerical example in a small network in which the results obtained by adopting the deterministic or probabilistic models for the PCP are compared.

In light of the uncertainty of customers in logistics distribution and the widely applied two-dimensional loading patterns in transportation, we propose and formulate a two-dimensional loading-constrained vehicle routing problem with stochastic customers (2L-VRPSC), where each customer has a known probability of presence and customers’ demands are a set of non-stackable items. A stochastic modeling platform of 2L-VRPSC is established based on a Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis to minimize the expected total transportation cost. To achieve this, an enhanced adaptive tabu search (EATS) algorithm incorporating the multi-order bottom-fill-skyline (MOBFS) packing heuristic is proposed, where the EATS algorithm searches for the optimal routing combination and the MOBFS checks the feasibility of each route and guides the EATS to search for feasible solutions.

Thus, new micro-mobility transportation modes such as e-scooter sharing systems have been introduced to fill the gaps in the transportation network. Furthermore, some recent studies examined e-scooters as a green option from the standpoint of environmental sustainability. Currently, e-scooter charging is conducted by competitive freelancers who do not consider the negative environmental impact resulting from not optimizing the fuel efficiency of their charging trips. Several disputes have been recorded among freelance chargers, especially when simultaneously arriving at an e-scooters location. The paper aims to find the optimal tours for all chargers to pick up e-scooters in the form of routes, such that each route contains one charger, and each e-scooter is visited only once by the set of routes, which are typically called an E-Scooter-Chargers Allocation (ESCA) solution. This study develops a mathematical model for the assignment of e-scooters to freelance chargers and adapts a simulated annealing metaheuristic to determine a near-optimal solution. We evaluated the proposed approach using real-world instances and a benchmark-simulated dataset. Moreover, we compare the proposed model benchmark dataset to the baseline (i.e., state-of-practice). The results show a reduction of approximately 61–79% in the total distance traveled, leading to shorter charging trips.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:18","2024-04-22 19:32:18","","","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","simulated annealing; assignment problem; e-scooters; freelancers; micro-mobility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in particular depend on the production of agricultural products; thus, drought has become a critical problem in such countries. The average water level in the lower part of the Mekong River has been decreasing dramatically, resulting in the wider agricultural area of the Mekong watershed facing a lack of water for production. The construction of community reservoirs and associated water supply networks represents a strategy that can be used to address drought problems in the GMS. This study aims to solve the agricultural community reservoir establishment and water supply network design (CR–WSND) problem in Khong Chiam, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand—a city located in the Mekong Basin. The CR–WSND model is formulated using mixed-integer programming (MIP) in order to minimize the cost of reservoir construction and water irrigation. An adjusted variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search (A-VaNSAS) is applied to a real-world scenario involving 218 nodes, and its performance is compared with that of the original variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search (VaNSAS), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An improved box selection formula and newly designed improvement black boxes are added to enhance the quality beyond the original VaNSAS. The results reveal that the quality of the solution from A-VaNSAS is significantly better than those of GA, DE, and VaNSAS (by 6.27%, 9.70%, and 9.65%, respectively); thus, A-VaNSAS can be used to design a community reservoir and water supply network effectively.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:18","2024-04-22 19:32:18","","","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","genetic algorithm; variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search; differential evolution; location–allocation sizing problem; water reservoir","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the FSTSP’s high complexity, we propose an effective heuristic based on simulated annealing (SA) to solve the problem.

This paper focuses on the research object of municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and transportation based on the concept of “sustainable development and green economy”. Firstly, this study examines the current state of urban domestic garbage collection and transportation. It analyzes the following challenges and deficiencies of the existing collection and transportation system: (1) the operating efficiency of garbage collection vehicles is low, resulting in a significant accumulation of waste on the roadside and within the community; (2) the vehicle collection and transportation routes are fixed, and there are empty vehicles running; (3) the amount of garbage on a route exceeds the vehicle’s loading capacity, which requires the vehicle to perform a second round of collection and transportation. To enhance the efficiency of urban garbage collection and transportation and minimize the collection and transportation costs, we are investigating the problem of optimizing the path for green vehicles. To comprehensively optimize the fixed cost, variable cost, and carbon emission cost incurred during vehicle operation, a vehicle routing model with time windows is established, taking into account vehicle load constraints. Carbon emission coefficient and carbon tax parameters are introduced into the model and the “fuel-carbon emission” conversion method is used to measure the carbon cost of enterprises. An improved ant colony optimization (ACO) method is proposed: (1) the introduction of a vehicle load factor improves the ant state transfer method; (2) the updated pheromone method is improved, and additional pheromone is added to both the feasible path and the path with the minimum objective function; (3) the max–min ACO algorithm is introduced to address the issue of premature convergence of the algorithm; (4) the embedding of a 2-opt algorithm further prevents the ACO algorithm from falling into the local optimum. Finally, the calculation results based on the example data demonstrate that the algorithm has a significant advantage over the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The total transportation distance determined by this algorithm is shorter than that of the GA and PSO methods, and the total cost of the scheme is 1.66% and 1.89% lower than that determined by GA and PSO, respectively. Compared to the data from the actual case, the number of vehicles required in the operation of this algorithm and model is reduced by three. Additionally, the total cost, fixed cost, and carbon emission cost incurred by the vehicles during operation were reduced by 31.2%, 60%, and 25.3% respectively. The results of this study help the station to collect and distribute waste efficiently, while also achieving the goals of energy saving, consumption reduction, and emission reduction.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:38","2024-04-22 19:32:38","","","","22","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","urban traffic; green and low-carbon; municipal solid waste management; network analysis; vehicle route optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of the waste collection robot MARBLE (Mobile Autonomous Robot for Litter Emptying) every SEA has characteristics like varying area and number of litter bins, with different distances between litter bins and uncertain filling levels of litter bins. Global positions of litter bins and garbage drop-off positions from MARBLEs after reaching their maximum capacity are defined as task-performing waypoints. We provide boundary delimitation for characteristics that describe the SEA. The boundaries interpolate synergy between individual SEAs and the developed algorithms. This helps in determining which algorithm best suits an SEA, dependent on the characteristics. The developed route-planning methodologies are based on vehicle routing with simulated annealing (VRPSA) and knapsack problems (KSPs). VRPSA uses specific weighting based on route permutation operators, initial temperature, and the nearest neighbor approach. The KSP optimizes a route’s given capacity, in this case using smart litter bins (SLBs) information. The game-theory KSP algorithm with SLBs information and the KSP algorithm without SLBs information performs better on SEAs lower than 0.5 km2, and with fewer than 50 litter bins. When the standard deviation of the fill rate of litter bins is ≈10%, the KSP without SLB is preferred, and if the standard deviation is between 25 and 40%, then the game-theory KSP is selected. Finally, the vehicle routing problem outperforms in SEAs with an area of 0.5≤5 km2, 50–450 litter bins, and a fill rate of 10–40%.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:38","2024-04-22 19:32:38","","","","6","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knapsack problem; vehicle routing problem; simulated annealing; game theory; robot fleet management; sustainable waste management; urban service robots; varying Service Event Areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces an advanced approach to optimizing the maximum power point while ensuring real-time PV error handling. The overarching problem of securing continuous monitoring of photovoltaic systems is highlighted, emphasizing the need for reliable performance, especially in remote and inaccessible locations. The proposed methodology employs an innovative genetic algorithm (GA) designed to optimize the maximum power point of photovoltaic systems. This approach takes into account critical PV parameters and constraints. The single-diode PV modeling process, based on environmental variables like outdoor temperature, illuminance, and irradiance, plays a pivotal role in the optimization process. To specifically address the challenge of perpetual monitoring, the paper introduces a technique for handling PV errors in real time using evolutionary-based optimization. The genetic algorithm is utilized to estimate the maximum power point, with the PV voltage and current calculated on the basis of simulated values. A meticulous comparison between the expected electrical output and the actual photovoltaic data is conducted to identify potential errors in the photovoltaic system. A user interface provides a dynamic display of the PV system’s real-time status, generating alerts when abnormal PV values are detected. Rigorous testing under real-world conditions, incorporating PV-monitored values and outdoor environmental parameters, demonstrates the remarkable accuracy of the genetic algorithm, surpassing 98% in predicting PV current, voltage, and power. This establishes the proposed algorithm as a potent solution for ensuring the perpetual and secure monitoring of PV systems, particularly in remote and challenging environments.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:38","2024-04-22 19:32:38","","","","23","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","evolutionary algorithm; photovoltaic parameters; PV error handling; PV monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chain supermarkets should pay attention to path optimization in the process of distribution to reduce carbon emissions. This study takes chain supermarkets as the research object, focusing on the optimization of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) in supermarket store distribution. Firstly, based on the concept of cost-effectiveness, we constructed a green and low-carbon distribution route optimization model with the lowest cost. With cost minimization as the objective function, the total distribution cost in the vehicle delivery process includes fixed cost, transportation cost, and carbon emission cost. The carbon emission cost is calculated using the carbon tax mechanism. Secondly, through integrating the Floyd algorithm, the nearest neighbor algorithm, and the insertion algorithm, a fusion heuristic algorithm was proposed for model solving, and an empirical study was conducted using the W chain supermarket in Wuhan as an example. The experimental results show that optimizing distribution routes considering carbon emission cost can effectively reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, it can also reduce the total costs of enterprises and society, thereby achieving greater social benefits at lower costs.

Effective planning of AGV transportation can reduce equipment energy consumption and shorten task completion time. Multiple AGVs transport containers between storage blocks and vessels, which can be regarded as the supply sides and demand points of containers. To meet the requirements of shipment in terms of timely and high-efficient delivery, multiple AGVs should be dispatched to deliver containers, which includes assigning tasks and selecting paths. A contract net protocol (CNP) is employed for task assignment in a multiagent system, while machine learning provides a logical alternative, such as Q-learning (QL), for complex path planning. In this study, mathematical models for multi-AGV dispatching are established, and a QL-CNP algorithm is proposed to tackle the multi-AGV dispatching problem (MADP). The distribution of traffic load is balanced for multiple AGVs performing tasks in the road network. The proposed model is validated using a Gurobi solver with a small experiment. Then, QL-CNP is used to conduct experiments with different sizes. The other algorithms, including Dijkstra, GA, and PSO, are also compared with the QL-CNP algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed QL-CNP when addressing the MADP.","2023","2024-04-22 19:32:59","2024-04-22 19:32:59","","","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Q-learning; energy consumption; multiagent; AGV dispatching; distribution balance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Short Sea Shipping (SSS) problem aims to efficiently disperse passenger flows involving multiple vessel routes and intermediary hubs through which passengers are transferred to their final destination. The problem contains elements of the Hub-and-Spoke and Travelling Salesman, with different levels of passenger flows among islands, making it more demanding than the typical H&S one, as the hub selection within nodes and the shortest routes among islands are internal optimization goals. This work introduces a multi-objective tri-level optimization algorithm for the General Network of Short Sea Shipping (GNSSS) problem to reduce travel distances and transportation costs while improving travel quality and user satisfaction, mainly by minimizing passenger hours spent on board. The analysis is performed at three levels of decisions: (a) the hub node assignment, (b) the island-to-line assignment, and (c) the island service sequence within each line. Due to the magnitude and complexity of the problem, a genetic algorithm is employed for the implementation. The algorithm performance has been tested and evaluated through several real and simulated case studies of different sizes and operational scenarios. The results indicate that the algorithm provides rational solutions in accordance with the desired sub-objectives. The multi-objective consideration leads to solutions that are quite scattered in the solution space, indicating the necessity of employing formal optimization methods. Typical Pareto diagrams present non-dominated solutions varying at a range of 30 percent in terms of the total distance traveled and more than 50 percent in relation to the cumulative passenger hours. Evaluation results further indicate satisfactory algorithm performance in terms of result stability (repeatability) and computational time requirements. In conclusion, the work provides a tool for assisting network operation and transport planning decisions by shipping companies in the directions of cost reduction and traveler service upgrade. In addition, the model can be adapted to other applications in transportation and in the supply chain.","2023","2024-04-22 19:33:00","2024-04-22 19:33:00","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; genetic algorithms; Hub-and-Spoke network; marine transportation; Short Sea Shipping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low loading rates caused by numerous types of containers and cost increases caused by low loading and unloading efficiency are still remaining issues in the process of goods delivery and packing. This study introduced the pallet with telescopic support height as the middle to address these issues and proposed a distribution scheme based on the constraints of three-dimensional pallet loading with a time window. First, combining the path optimization of the time window and cargo loading, a solution model was established to solve the existing express delivery problem with the lowest total delivery cost and the highest average vehicle loading rate. In addition, the multi-objective problem was transformed through the multi-objective linear weighting method. Second, we cluster the customer nodes. In order to solve the large number of gaps generated by the hierarchy theory, we adopt the descending order of cargo volume as the initial sequence and design the coding and decoding for path optimization and pallet loading, solving the problem through the simulated anneal-genetic algorithm.

The efficient operation of the hybrid aerial and ground vehicle, particularly routings, remains a challenge. The present study proposed a collaborative hybrid aerial and ground vehicle to support the operation of post-disaster assessment. The study developed two models, i.e., the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem combined with Assignment (2EVRPA) and the Two-Echelon Collaborative Vehicle Routing Problem (2ECoVRP) to evaluate optimal routings for both aerial and ground vehicles. The difference lies in the second echelon in which the 2EVRPA uses a single point-to-point assignment, whereas the 2ECoVRP considers the collaborative routings between the ground vehicle and the aerial vehicle. To demonstrate its applicability, the developed models were applied to solve the post-disaster assessment for the Mount Merapi eruption in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Sets of numerical experiments based on the empirical case were conducted. The findings indicate that the 2ECoVRP performs better than 2EVRPA in terms of the total operation time. The tabu search algorithm was found to be a promising method to solve the models due to its good quality solution and computational efficiency.

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is the issue of defining the assumptions and limitations in mapping routes for vehicles performing certain operational activities. It is a major problem in logistics transportation. In specific areas of business, where transportation can be perceived as added value to the product, it is estimated that its optimization can lower costs up to 25% in total. The economic benefits for more open markets are a key point for VRP. This paper discusses the metaheuristics usage for solving the vehicle routing problem with special attention toward Genetic Algorithms (GAs).

Real operations for general freight involve a high degree of complexity due to daily variability. Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a method that can mimic real operations and include stochastic parameters. However, realistic vehicle routing is difficult to build in DES models. The objective is to create a DES model for realistic freight routing, which considers the driver’s routing decisions. Realistic models need to predict the delivery route (including time and distance) for variable consignment address and backhaul pickup. Geographic information systems (GIS) and DES were combined to develop freight PUD models. GIS was used to process geographical data. Two DES models were developed and compared. The first was a simple suburb model, and the second an intersection-based model. Real industrial data were applied including one-year consignment data and global positioning system (GPS) data. A case study of one delivery tour is shown, with results validated with actual GPS data. The DES results were also compared with conventional GIS models. The result shows the intersection-based model is adequate to mimic actual PUD routing. This work provides a method for combining GIS and DES to build freight operation models for urban PUD. This has the potential to help industry logistics practitioners better understand their current operations and experiment with different scenarios.","2021","2024-04-22 19:33:39","2024-04-22 19:33:39","","","","12","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","dynamic routing; discrete-event simulation; freight delivery with backhaul pickup; geographic information system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of these tests were incorporated into the optimization model as the depreciation rate and charge time over battery life.

Thus, we deal with a multi-period vehicle routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, with customers’ requirements and company restrictions to satisfy, in which the fleet composition has to be daily defined. In fact, the company has a fleet of owned vehicles and the possibility to select, day by day, a certain number of vehicles from the fleet of a third-party company.

Sustainable logistics and distribution management can help reduce greenhouse gases emission and lighten its influence against our living environment. Quantum computing has become more and more popular in recent years for advancing artificial intelligence into the next generation. Hence, we apply quantum random number generator to provide true random numbers for the genetic algorithm to solve the pollution-routing problems (PRPs) in sustainable logistics management in this paper. The objective of the PRPs is to minimize carbon dioxide emissions, following one of the seventeen sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. We developed a two-phase hybrid model combining a modified k-means algorithm as a clustering method and a genetic algorithm with quantum random number generator as an optimization engine to solve the PRPs aiming to minimize the pollution produced by trucks traveling along delivery routes. We also compared the computation performance with another hybrid model by using a different optimization engine, i.e., the tabu search algorithm. From the experimental results, we found that both hybrid models can provide good solution quality for CO2 emission minimization for 29 PRPs out of a total of 30 instances (30 runs each for all problems).","2021","2024-04-22 19:33:58","2024-04-22 19:33:58","","","","15","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","genetic algorithm; pollution-routing problem; quantum computing; sustainable logistic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem of allocating resources to these road-side incidents can be stated as a multi-objective function and a large set of constraints, including priorities and preferences, resource capacities and skills, calendars, and extra hours. The request from the client is to a have real-time response and to attempt to use only open source tools.

Real-life situations discussed in the relevant research include time windows and vehicle capabilities. Among the constraints in a VRPTW, the practical consideration of the fairness of drivers’ performance bonuses has seldom been discussed in the literature. However, the shortest routes and balanced performance bonuses for all sales drivers are usually in conflict. To balance the bonuses awarded to all drivers, an auction bidding approach was developed to address this practical consideration. The fairness of performance bonuses was considered in the proposed mathematical model. The nearest urgent candidate heuristic used in the auction bidding approach determined the auction price of the sales drivers. The proposed algorithm both achieved a performance bonus balance and planned the shortest route for each driver. To evaluate the performance of the auction bidding approach, several test instances were generated based on VRPTW benchmark data instances. This study also involved sensitivity and scenario analyses to assess the effect of the algorithm’s parameters on the solutions. The results show that the proposed approach efficiently obtained the optimal routes and satisfied the practical concerns in the VRPTW.","2021","2024-04-22 19:33:59","2024-04-22 19:33:59","","","","16","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem with time windows; performance bonus; auctions/bidding; multi-agent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, advanced optimization techniques are required to design sustainable routes with low logistic costs. Moreover, these negative impacts may be significantly increased as a consequence of the lack of synergy between the sustainability objectives. Correspondingly, the concept of transport optimization in smart cities is becoming popular in both the real world and academia when public decision making is lit by operations research models. In this paper, however, we argue that the level of urban smartness depends on its sustainability and on the level of information and communication technologies developed in the city. Therefore, the operations research models seek to achieve a higher threshold in the sustainable transport standards in smart cities. Thus, we present a generic definition of smart city, which includes the triple bottom line of sustainability, with the purpose of analyzing its effects on city performance.

The calculated absolute optimal solution for this field can be used as the basis for benchmarking of metaheuristic algorithms used for finding the most efficient route in the field. The problem of finding the most efficient route that covers a field can be formulated as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is an NP-hard problem. This means that the optimal solution is infeasible to calculate, except for very small fields. Therefore, a range of metaheuristic methods has been developed that provide a near-optimal solution to a TSP in a “reasonable” time. The main challenge with metaheuristic methods is that the quality of the solutions can normally not be compared to the absolute optimal solution since this “ground truth” value is unknown. Even though the selected benchmarking field requires only eight tracks, the solution space consists of more than 1.3 billion solutions. In this study, the absolute optimal solution for the capacitated coverage path planning problem was determined by calculating the non-working distance of the entire solution space and determining the solution with the shortest non-working distance. This was done for four scenarios consisting of low/high bin capacity and short/long distance between field and storage depot. For each scenario, the absolute optimal solution and its associated cost value (minimum non-working distance) were compared to the solutions of two metaheuristic algorithms; Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The benchmarking showed that neither algorithm could find the optimal solution for all scenarios, but they found near-optimal solutions, with only up to 6 pct increasing non-working distance. SAA performed better than ACO, concerning quality, stability, and execution time.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:20","2024-04-22 19:34:20","","","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; simulated annealing algorithm; ant colony optimization; absolute optimal route; benchmarking; capacitated field operations; coverage path planning; operation management; precision farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the development of e-commerce, high timelines and quality have become a new pursuit for agriproduct online retailing. To satisfy the new demands of customers, reducing the time from receiving orders to distribution and improving agriproduct quality are significantly needed advancements. In this study, we focus on the joint optimization of the fulfillment of online tomato orders that integrates picking and distribution simultaneously within the context of the farm-to-door model. A tomato maturity model with a firmness indicator is proposed firstly. Then, we incorporate the tomato maturity model function into the integrated picking and distribution schedule and formulate a multiple-vehicle routing problem with time windows. Next, to solve the model, an improved genetic algorithm (the sweep-adaptive genetic algorithm, S-AGA) is addressed. Finally, we prove the validity of the proposed model and the superiority of S-AGA with different numerical experiments. The results show that significant improvements are obtained in the overall tomato supply chain efficiency and quality. For instance, tomato quality and customer satisfaction increased by 5% when considering the joint optimization, and the order processing speed increased over 90% compared with traditional GA. This study could provide scientific tomato picking and distribution scheduling to satisfy the multiple requirements of consumers and improve agricultural and logistics sustainability.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:20","2024-04-22 19:34:20","","","","19","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","farm-to-door distribution; joint optimization; maturity; picking; sweep-adaptive genetic algorithm; tomato","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this problem, customers define a time slot, within which they must be served by vehicles of a standard capacity. The aim is to define cost-effective routes, minimizing both the number of vehicles and the total traveled distance. When we seek to minimize both attributes at the same time, the problem is considered as multiobjective. Although numerous exact, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been developed to solve the various vehicle routing problems, including the VRPTW, only a few of them face these problems as multiobjective. In the present paper, a Multiobjective Large Neighborhood Search (MOLNS) algorithm is developed to solve the VRPTW. The algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language, and it is evaluated in Solomon’s 56 benchmark instances with 100 customers, as well as in Gehring and Homberger’s benchmark instances with 1000 customers. The results obtained from the algorithm are compared to the best-published, in order to validate the algorithm’s efficiency and performance. The algorithm is proven to be efficient both in the quality of results, as it offers three new optimal solutions in Solomon’s dataset and produces near optimal results in most instances, and in terms of computational time, as, even in cases with up to 1000 customers, good quality results are obtained in less than 15 min. Having the potential to effectively solve real life distribution problems, the present paper also discusses a practical real-life application of this algorithm.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:20","2024-04-22 19:34:20","","","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRPTW; metaheuristic; vehicle routing problem; multiobjective optimization; time windows; freight transportation; large neighborhood search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tasks carried out by such systems are mainly associated with an aerial reconnaissance using Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) systems and Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) to support military operations. Execution of a professional reconnaissance of the indicated objects requires determining the UAV flight trajectory in the close neighborhood of the target, in order to collect as much interesting information as possible. The paper describes the algorithm for determining UAV flight trajectories, which is tasked with identifying the indicated objectives using the sensors specified in the order. The presence of UAV threatening objects is taken into account. The task of determining the UAV flight trajectory for recognition of the target is a component of the planning process of the tactical class UAV mission, which is also presented in the article. The problem of determining the optimal UAV trajectory has been decomposed into several subproblems: determining the reconnaissance flight method in the vicinity of the currently recognized target depending on the sensor used and the required parameters of the recognition product (photo, film, or SAR scan), determining the initial possible flight trajectory that takes into account potential UAV threats, and planning detailed flight trajectory considering the parameters of the air platform based on the maneuver planning algorithm designed for tactical class platforms. UAV route planning algorithms with time constraints imposed on the implementation of individual tasks were used to solve the task of determining UAV flight trajectories. The problem was formulated in the form of a Mixed Integer Linear Problem (MILP) model. For determining the flight path in the neighborhood of the target, the optimal control algorithm was also presented in the form of a MILP model. The determined trajectory is then corrected based on the construction algorithm for determining real UAV flight segments based on Dubin curves.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:20","2024-04-22 19:34:20","","","","19","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","trajectory planning; UAV; aerial surveillance; electro-optical/infrared camera (EO/IR); synthetic aperture radar (SAR); vehicle route planning with time windows (VRPTW)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first paper was published in 1959, and later, many vehicle routing problem variants appeared to simulate real logistical systems. Since vehicle routing problem is an NP-difficult task, the problem can be solved by approximation algorithms. Metaheuristics give a “good” result within an “acceptable” time. When developing a new metaheuristic algorithm, researchers usually use only their intuition and test results to verify the efficiency of the algorithm, comparing it to the efficiency of other algorithms. However, it may also be necessary to analyze the search operators of the algorithms for deeper investigation. The fitness landscape is a tool for that purpose, describing the possible states of the search space, the neighborhood operator, and the fitness function. The goal of fitness landscape analysis is to measure the complexity and efficiency of the applicable operators. The paper aims to investigate the fitness landscape of a complex vehicle routing problem. The efficiency of the following operators is investigated: 2-opt, order crossover, partially matched crossover, cycle crossover. The results show that the most efficient one is the 2-opt operator. Based on the results of fitness landscape analysis, we propose a novel traveling salesman problem genetic algorithm optimization variant where the edges are the elementary units having a fitness value. The optimal route is constructed from the edges having good fitness value. The fitness value of an edge depends on the quality of the container routes. Based on the performed comparison tests, the proposed method significantly dominates many other optimization approaches.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:20","2024-04-22 19:34:20","","","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; traveling salesman problem; vehicle routing problem; fitness landscape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such scenarios, heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP) is generally applied to plan an optimal delivery. However, in many downtown cores of large and rapidly developing Southeast Asian cities, HFVRP is neither viable nor reliable because of road usage restrictions. The purpose of this article is to develop and test a different approach that accurately takes these restrictions into account and provides viable and more sustainable results. Restrictions in this paper refer to situations of urban areas in Vietnam where (i) certain vehicle types are prohibited in specified areas or where narrow alleyways limit the utilization of vehicles that exceed the road capacity and (ii) certain roads are exclusive to certain vehicle types. In networks, limited access and exclusive lanes are represented as links, or arcs, exclusive to one or another. Taking these limitations into consideration, we have developed a unique model, which we have termed Vehicle Routing Problem with Exclusive Links (VRP-EL). The model was validated and tested for its performance on scenarios with varying ratios of exclusive links. Scenarios up to 500 customers were tested on a meta-heuristic algorithm, simulated annealing. VRP-EL produces realistic outcomes. Limiting certain links to be selected according to vehicle types increases overall travel distance. However, this increase outweighs the cost of re-planning and rerouting had they not been constrained initially. The reduction in traveling distance leads to fossil fuel reduction for the overall system. The estimation of reduced carbon emissions through applying the proposed model is presented. Considering the severe traffic congestion and carbon emissions caused by motorcycles in Vietnam, the proposed model leads to a sustainable road environment.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:42","2024-04-22 19:34:42","","","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","simulated annealing; vehicle routing problems; courier services; urban logistics; carbon emissions reduction; exclusive lanes; exclusive motorcycle lanes; motorcycle delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to limited capacities, such as battery power, it is almost impossible for a single unmanned vehicle to complete a large-scale mission area. An unmanned vehicle swarm has the potential to distribute tasks and coordinate the operations of many robots/drones with very little operator intervention. Therefore, multiple unmanned vehicles are required to execute a set of well-planned mission routes, in order to minimize time and energy consumption. A two-phase heuristic algorithm was used to pursue this goal. In the first phase, a tabu search and the 2-opt node exchange method were used to generate a single optimal path for all target nodes; the solution was then split into multiple clusters according to vehicle numbers as an initial solution for each. In the second phase, a tabu algorithm combined with a 2-opt path exchange was used to further improve the in-route and cross-route solutions for each route. This diversification strategy allowed for approaching the global optimal solution, rather than a regional one with less CPU time. After these algorithms were coded, a group of three robot cars was used to validate this hybrid path programming algorithm.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:42","2024-04-22 19:34:42","","","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tabu search; multi-robots; path programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current literature frequently studies economic and environmental dimensions, but rarely focuses on social aspects, let alone an analysis of the combination of the three abovementioned aspects. This paper considers the three benefits simultaneously, aiming at facilitating decision-making for a comprehensive solution to the capacitated vehicle routing problem in the MSW collection system, where the number and location of vehicles, depots, and disposal facilities are predetermined beforehand. Besides the traditional concerns of economic costs, this paper considers environmental issues correlated to the carbon emissions generated from burning fossil fuels, and evaluates social benefits by penalty costs which are derived from imbalanced trip assignments for disposal facilities. Then, the optimization model is proposed to minimize system costs composed of fixed costs of vehicles, fuel consumption costs, carbon emissions costs, and penalty costs. Two meta-heuristic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and tabu search (TS), are adopted for a two-phase algorithm to obtain an efficient solution for the proposed model. A balanced solution is acquired and the results suggest a compromise between economic, environmental, and social benefits.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:42","2024-04-22 19:34:42","","","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","capacitated vehicle routing problem; municipal solid waste collection; sustainable management; two-phase algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The collection of waste from the collection points herein is modeled as a multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), aiming at minimizing the total transportation distance. In this study, we propose a heuristic solution method to address this problem. In this method, we firstly assign waste collection points to waste disposal plants according to the nearest distance, then each plant solves the single-vehicle routing problem (VRP) respectively, assigning customers to vehicles and planning the order in which customers are visited by vehicles. In the latter step, we propose the sector combination optimization (SCO) algorithm to generate multiple initial solutions, and then these initial solutions are improved using the merge-head and drop-tail (MHDT) strategy. After a certain number of iterations, the optimal solution in the last generation is reported. Computational experiments on benchmark instances showed that the initial solutions obtained by the sector combination optimization algorithm were more abundant and better than other iterative algorithms using only one solution for initialization, and the solutions with distance gap were obtained using the merge-head and drop-tail strategy in a lower CPU time compared to the Tabu search algorithm.","2020","2024-04-22 19:34:42","2024-04-22 19:34:42","","","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","multi-depot vehicle routing problem; merge-head and drop-tail strategy; sector combination optimization algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to provide managerial insights to design a win-win strategy for the co-existence of traditional and green business models. In doing so, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates a qualitative analysis through a Lean Business methodology, named GUEST, with a quantitative analysis based on simulation-optimisation techniques. This kind of holistic vision has received little attention in the literature. The first analysis investigates the parcel delivery industry with an emphasis on the main business models involved, their costs and revenues structures, while the quantitative part aims to simulate the system and extract sustainable policies. In particular, results highlight that in deploying mixed-fleet policies, the decision-makers have to focus both on the environmental sustainability that benefits from the adoption of low-emission vehicles, and on the operational feasibility and economic sustainability of the two services. In this direction, the paper suggests some managerial insights concerning the split of the customer demand between traditional and green operators, according to the classes of parcels and geographical areas of the city.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:00","2024-04-22 19:35:00","","","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GUEST methodology; Last-Mile Logistics; urban delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores how the unevenly distributed demand and supply can be optimally matched through collaborations, and formulates and solves a Collaborative Pickup and Delivery Problem under Time Windows (CPDPTW) to optimize the structures of logistics networks and improve city sustainability and liverability. The CPDPTW is a three-stage framework. First, a multi-objective linear optimization model that minimizes the number of vehicles and the total cost of logistics operation is developed.

The clustering algorithm helps to identify the feasible initial solution to INSGA-II. Third, a method based on improved Shapley value model is proposed to obtain the collaborative alliance strategy that achieves the optimal profit allocation strategy. The proposed composite algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in minimizing terms of the total cost and number of electro-tricycles.

The problem addressed in this paper considers two objectives to optimize simultaneously: minimize the caregivers’ travel costs and maximize the patients’ preferences. In this paper, different methods based on the bi-objective non-dominated sorting algorithm are proposed to solve the vehicle routing problem with time windows, preferences, and timing constraints.

Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:01","2024-04-22 19:35:01","","","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRP; UAVs; TSP; optimization problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both the electric vehicle routing model and the traditional fuel vehicle routing model are constructed aiming at minimizing the total costs, which includes the fixed costs of vehicles, depreciation costs, penalty costs for violating customer time window, energy costs and carbon trading costs. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed to address these two models, the advantages of greedy algorithm and random full permutation are combined to set the initial population, at the same time, the crossover operation is improved to retain the excellent gene fragments effectively and the hill climbing algorithm is embedded to enhance the local search ability of HGA. Furthermore, a case data is used with HGA to carry out computational experiments in these two models and the results indicate that first using electric vehicles for distribution can indeed reduce the carbon emissions, but results in a low customer satisfaction compared with using fuel vehicles. Besides, the battery capacity and charge rate have a great influence on total costs of using electric vehicles. Second, carbon price plays an important role in the transformation of logistics companies. As the carbon price changes, the total costs, carbon trading costs, and carbon emissions of using electric vehicles and fuel vehicles are affected accordingly, yet the trends are different. The changes of carbon quota have nothing to do with the distribution scheme and companies’ transformation but influence the total costs of using electric and fuel vehicles for distribution, and the trends are the same. These reasonable proposals can support the government on carbon trading policy, and also the logistics companies on dealing the relationship between economic and social benefits.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:01","2024-04-22 19:35:01","","","","17","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","electric vehicle; hybrid genetic algorithm; routing problem; carbon prices; carbon quotas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of note, population density is higher, and vehicles encounter greater restrictions. Moreover, air pollution from fossil fuel combustion is more severe. As tailpipe emissions are becoming costly to both corporations and the environment, researchers are increasingly exploring more appealing transportation options. Electric bicycles have become an important mode of transportation in some countries in the past decade. Electric bicycles and automobiles have their respective merits and demerits when used to provide courier services. E-bikes in particular can ply their trade in densely packed areas that are off-limits to cars and trucks. This paper focuses on (1) developing a truck–bike mixture model to reduce operating costs for an existing truck-only service by replacing some of the trucks with bicycles, and (2) exploring the resulting effects in terms of reducing overall carbon emissions. Data from one of the major courier companies in South Korea were utilized. The problem was tackled as a heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem using simulated annealing because the actual size of the problem cannot be solved directly with a mathematical approach. The most effective fleet mix was found for the company’s case. Effects on operating costs and reduced emissions were analyzed for 15 different scenarios with varying demands and off-limits areas. Computational results revealed that the new model is viable from economic and sustainability standpoints. They indicated that costs decrease to varying degrees in all scenarios, and that carbon emissions also decrease by around 10% regardless of the selected scenario.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:32","2024-04-22 19:35:32","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","carbon emissions; courier services; electric bicycle; truck delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These solutions can be summarized into either finding other clean, renewable sources or managing the available sources optimally. This research represents smart electrical interconnection management between some of the Egyptian seaports for optimal operation, with a clean sustainable environment as the target. The optimum ports’ commitment operation works through certain technical constraints to attain optimal economic and environmental factors. One of the main objectives of this study is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which is released from the electrical power generation that covers the seaports demands. It is progressed through the green port smart commitment, by incorporating unpolluted and renewable energy resources. This study depends on the redesign of some Egyptian seaports to be green ports with eco-friendly electrical construction. According to the new electrical design, two out of the six studied seaports can be considered as renewable energy generation units consisting of Photovoltaic (PV) electrical generation resources. The new design of the seaports electrical network can be considered as a hybrid network, collecting both fossil fuel electrical power generation and PV sources. To gain benefits from the diversity in geographical behaviors, ports on the red sea and Mediterranean sea are integrated into the network cloud. Connecting ports on red and Mediterranean seas construct a network cloud, which supports the operation of the whole network under different conditions. Hybrid (weighted-discrete) Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (HPSOT) is an effective optimization technique which is applied to provide the optimum interconnection management between the eco-ports. It is developed based on some technical constraints which are the availability of the network buses interconnection, the voltage and frequency levels, and deviations due to the smart unit interconnection and the re-direction of the power flow. The HPSOT is targeted to minimize the economical cost and the harmful environmental impact of the seaport electrical network, while covering the overall network load. The HPSOT is programmed utilizing the Matlab program. It is tested on the six Egyptian seaports network that consists of El Dekheila, Alexandria, and Damietta on the Mediteranean and Port Said, Suez, and Sokhna port on the Suez canal and Red sea. It verifies its accurateness and efficiency in decreasing the combined cost function involving costs of CO2 emission. CO2 emission is reduced to 6% of its previous value for the same consumed electrical energy, that means it has a positive impact on retarding the greenhouse effect and climate change.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:32","2024-04-22 19:35:32","","","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eco-ports smart commitment; Egyptian seaports; environmental sustainability; green ports; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (HPSOT); optimization techniques; Photovoltaic (PV) power generation; renewable electrical energy resources.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most often considered aspects of the DVRP is the availability of customers, in which a part or all of the customers are revealed dynamically during the design or execution of the routes. A classification of the DVRP problem due to various elements causing dynamism is proposed. The aim of the paper is to distinguish dynamic VRP, which takes into account the dynamic appearance of customers to serve during the design or execution of the routes. In particular, the difference between the predictive and unexpected aspects of the customer’s availability is considered. Above all, the variant of customer’s availability which is predicted according to an appropriate general rule is modeled using the algebraic-logical meta-model (ALMM). It is a methodology which enables making collective decisions in successive process stages, not separately for individual vehicles.

The fuel consumption cost relies on the distance and road conditions, in case of poor physical condition of a road, and its width, which can be affected the speed of the vehicle as well as the used fuel. Thus, we propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based on heuristic for solving the LRP. The ALNS method was tested with three datasets of samples divided into small, medium and large problems. Then, the results were compared with the results from the exact method by the Lingo program. The computational study indicated that the ALNS algorithm was competitive to the results of the Lingo for all instance sizes. Moreover, the ALNS was more effective than the exact method; approximately 99% in terms of processing time. We extended this approach to solve the case study, which was considered to be the largest problem, and the ALNS algorithm was efficient with acceptable solutions and short processing time. Therefore, the proposed method provided an effective solution to manage location routing decision of the palm oil collection center.","2019","2024-04-22 19:35:33","2024-04-22 19:35:33","","","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","adaptive large neighborhood search; location routing problem; fuel consumption; renewable energy crops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finally, a two-layer optimization algorithm was proposed to solve this integration problem. Through a case study, the results show this integration production–delivery model can reduce the cost of supply chains and improve customer satisfaction.

The cost of generation and emission of greenhouse gases is based on the calculation of the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from vehicles, which depends on such factors as the vehicle speed, weather conditions, load on the vehicle and traveled distance. The main applications of this problem are in municipalities for urban waste collection, road surface marking and so forth.

The fuel consumption depends on the distance of travel and the condition of the road. The condition of the road causes the vehicle to use a different speed, which affects fuel usage. This turns the original LRP into a more difficult problem. Moreover, the volume of the goods that are produced in each node could be more or less than the capacity of the vehicle, and as the case study requires the transportation of latex, which is a sensitive good and needs to be carried within a reasonable time so that it does not form solid before being used in the latex process, the maximum time that the latex can be in the truck is limited. All of these attributes are added into the LRP and make it a special case of LRP: a so-called SLRP (a special case of location routing problem). The differential evolution algorithms (DE) are proposed to solve the SLRP. We modified two points in the original DE, which are that (1) the mutation formula is introduced and (2) the new rule of a local search is presented. We call this the modified differential evolution algorithm (MDE).

Sabotage risk is the risk that a deliberate act of sabotage will happen in a living area or during the transportation of a vehicle. This can change the way decisions are made about the transportation problem when it is considered. The mathematical model of the MLLAP-SB is first presented and solved to optimality by using Lingo v. 11 optimization software, but it can solve only small numbers of test instances. Second, two heuristics are presented to solve large numbers of test instances that Lingo cannot solve to optimality within a reasonable time. The original differential evolution (DE) algorithm and the extended version of DE—the modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithm—are presented to solve the MLLAP-SB. From the computational result, when solving small numbers of test instances in which Lingo is able to find the optimality, DE and MDE are able to find a 100% optimal solution while requiring much lower computational time. Lingo uses an average 96,156.67 s to solve the problem, while DE and MDE use only 104 and 90 s, respectively. Solving large numbers of test instances where Lingo cannot solve the problem, MDE outperformed DE, as it found a 100% better solution than DE. MDE has an average 0.404% lower cost than DE when using a computational time of 90 min. The difference in cost between MDE and DE changes from 0.08% when using 10 min to 0.54% when using 100 min computational time. The computational result also explicitly shows that when sabotage risk is integrated into the method of solving the problem, it can reduce the average total cost from 32,772,361 baht to 30,652,360 baht, corresponding to a 9.61% reduction.","2018","2024-04-22 19:35:52","2024-04-22 19:35:52","","","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","modified differential evolution algorithm; differential evolution algorithm; renewable energy crops; location–allocation problem; risk conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their short range, extended recharging times, and insufficient charging facilities hinder the improvement in the market share of BEVs. As a remedy, this paper presents a novel approach to providing a service for the battery charge replenishment of BEVs. Instead of using traditional alternative methods by only providing a charging service in a fixed location, such as battery-swapping and charging lanes, the novel charge replenishment is provided by mobile charging vehicles (MCVs), which could offer a charging service at any time and at location requested. To consider the limited running range and the opportunity to recharge from MCVs, as well as to determine the location strategy of multiple types of plug-in charging facility locations and the routing plan of the MCVs simultaneously, the location routing problem (LRP) that can integrate two decision levels, with a strategic level (location) and tactical level (routing), is applied. Then, we present the multiple types of plug-in charging facilities’ location-routing problem with time windows for mobile charging vehicles (MTPCF-LRPwTW-MCVs), and formulate the MTPCF-LRPwTW-MCVs as a mixed integer linear program for the convenience of solving. To demonstrate the model, test instances are designed and computational results are presented. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on battery capacity, recharging rate, and so on, are also examined. The results show that with the increase of the battery capacity or the improvement of the charging rate of the charging facilities, the service efficiency of the MCVs can reasonably be improved. Therefore, the proposed method could be used in real world problems.","2018","2024-04-22 19:35:52","2024-04-22 19:35:52","","","","8","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","time windows; location-routing problem; battery electric vehicles; mobile charging services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To cope with this situation, we introduce disruption management to the real-time home caregiver scheduling and routing problem. The deviation measurements on customers, caregivers, and companies are first defined. A mathematical model that minimizes the weighted sum of deviation measurements is then constructed.

There are very few metrics able to make an effective measure of the machine intelligence quotient. The most important drawbacks of the designed metrics presented in the scientific literature consist in the limitation in universality, accuracy, and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel universal metric called MetrIntSimil capable of making an accurate and robust symmetric comparison of the similarity in intelligence of any number of cooperative multiagent systems specialized in difficult problem solving. The universality is an important necessary property based on the large variety of designed intelligent systems. MetrIntSimil makes a comparison by taking into consideration the variability in intelligence in the problem solving of the compared cooperative multiagent systems. It allows a classification of the cooperative multiagent systems based on their similarity in intelligence. A cooperative multiagent system has variability in the problem solving intelligence, and it can manifest lower or higher intelligence in different problem solving tasks. More cooperative multiagent systems with similar intelligence can be included in the same class. For the evaluation of the proposed metric, we conducted a case study for more intelligent cooperative multiagent systems composed of simple computing agents applied for solving the Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (STSP) that is a class of NP-hard problems.

The proposed model features passengers’ one or several preferred time windows for boarding vehicles at the demand point and their expected ride time. Moreover, passenger satisfaction that was related only to expected ride time is fully accounted for in the model. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the operation costs of total mileage and maximize passenger satisfaction. As the problem is an extension of the nondeterministic polynomial problem with integration of the vehicle route problem, this study further develops an improved bat algorithm to yield meta-optimal solutions for the model in a reasonable amount of time. When this was applied to a case study in Nanjing City, China, the mileage and satisfaction of the proposed model were reduced by 1.4 km and increased by 7.1%, respectively, compared with the traditional model. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to investigate the impact of the number of designed bus routes and weights of objective functions on the model performance. Finally, a comparison of Cplex, standard bat algorithm, and group search optimizer is analyzed to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm.","2018","2024-04-22 19:36:12","2024-04-22 19:36:12","","","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","heuristic algorithm; DRC transit system; multiple time window; passenger satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cooperative mechanisms can contribute to avoiding the inefficient assignment of resources for the recycling logistics operations and reducing long distance transportation. With regard to the relatively low performance of waste collection, this paper proposes a three-phase methodology to properly address the corresponding vehicle routing problem on two echelons. First, a bi-objective programming model is established to minimize the total cost and the number of vehicles considering semitrailers and vehicles sharing. Furthermore, the Clarke–Wright (CW) savings method and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) are combined to design a hybrid routing optimization heuristic, which is denoted CW_NSGA-II. Routes on the first and second echelons are obtained on the basis of sub-optimal solutions provided by CW algorithm. Compared to other intelligent algorithms, CW_NSGA-II reduces the complexity of the multi-objective solutions search and mostly converges to optimality. The profit generated by cooperation among retail stores and the recycling hub in the reverse logistics network is fairly and reasonably distributed to the participants by applying the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS) method. Finally, an empirical study in Chengdu City, China, reveals the superiority of CW_NSGA over the multi-objective particle swarm optimization and the multi objective genetic algorithms in terms of solutions quality and convergence. Meanwhile, the comparison of MCRS method with the Shapley value model, equal profit method and cost gap allocation proves that MCRS method is more conducive to the stability of the cooperative alliance. In general, the implementation of cooperation in the optimization of the reverse logistics network effectively leads to the sustainable development of urban and sub-urban areas. Through the reasonable reorganization of the entire network, recycling companies can provide more reliable services, contribute to the reduction of environmental pollution, and guarantee significant profits. Thus, this paper provides manufacturing companies, logistics operators and local governments with tools to protect the environment, while still making profits.","2018","2024-04-22 19:36:13","2024-04-22 19:36:13","","","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) complexity, many VROs involved in real-world applications require too much computing effort. Shortening computing time for VRO is a great challenge for state-of-the-art spatial optimization algorithms. From a spatial-temporal perspective, this paper presents a spatial-temporal Voronoi diagram-based heuristic approach for large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTW). Considering time constraints, a spatial-temporal Voronoi distance is derived from the spatial-temporal Voronoi diagram to find near neighbors in the space-time searching context. A Voronoi distance decay strategy that integrates a time warp operation is proposed to accelerate local search procedures. A spatial-temporal feature-guided search is developed to improve unpromising micro route structures. Experiments on VRPTW benchmarks and real-world instances are conducted to verify performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics and achieves high-quality solutions for large-scale instances of VRPTWs in a short time. This novel approach will contribute to spatial decision support community by developing an effective vehicle routing optimization method for large transportation applications in both public and private sectors.","2015","2024-04-22 19:36:31","2024-04-22 19:36:31","","2019-2044","","4","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","heuristics; local search; vehicle routing problem; Voronoi diagram; distance decay; spatial decision support system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, may help address this issue due to their suitability to reach and easily cover large areas. Thus, unmanned aerial vehicles may be used to inspect the terrain and make a first assessment of the affected areas; however, nowadays they do not have the capability to act. On the other hand, ground vehicles rely on enough power to perform the intervention but exhibit more mobility constraints. This paper proposes a multi-robot sense-act system, composed of aerial and ground vehicles. This combination allows performing autonomous tasks in large outdoor areas by integrating both types of platforms in a fully automated manner. Aerial units are used to easily obtain relevant data from the environment and ground units use this information to carry out interventions more efficiently. This paper describes the platforms and sensors required by this multi-robot sense-act system as well as proposes a software system to automatically handle the workflow for any generic environmental task. The proposed system has proved to be suitable to reduce the amount of herbicide applied in agricultural treatments. Although herbicides are very polluting, they are massively deployed on complete agricultural fields to remove weeds. Nevertheless, the amount of herbicide required for treatment is radically reduced when it is accurately applied on patches by the proposed multi-robot system. Thus, the aerial units were employed to scout the crop and build an accurate weed distribution map which was subsequently used to plan the task of the ground units. The whole workflow was executed in a fully autonomous way, without human intervention except when required by Spanish law due to safety reasons.","2016","2024-04-22 19:36:31","2024-04-22 19:36:31","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","collaborative robots; mixed robot fleet; multi-robot sense-act system; precision agriculture; site-specific treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this expansion strategy increases the demand for container exchange between terminals and their logistics facilities within a port, known as interterminal transport (ITT). ITT forms a complex transportation network in a large port, which must be managed efficiently given the economic and environmental implications. The use of trucks in ITT operations leads to the interterminal truck routing problem (ITTRP), which has been attracting increasing attention from researchers. One of the objectives of truck routing optimization in ITT is the minimization of empty-truck trips. Selection of the transport order (TO) based on the current truck location is critical in minimizing empty-truck trips. However, ITT entails not only transporting containers between terminals operated 24 h: in cases where containers need to be transported to a logistics facility within operating hours, empty-truck trip cost (ETTC) minimization must also consider the operational times of the transport origin and destination. Otherwise, truck waiting time might be incurred because the truck may arrive before the opening time of the facility. Truck waiting time seems trivial, but it is not, since thousands of containers move between locations within a port every day. So, truck waiting time can be a source of ITT-related costs if it is not managed wisely. Minimization of empty-truck trips and truck waiting time is considered a multiobjective optimization problem. This paper proposes a method of cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to produce TO truck routes that minimize ETTC and truck waiting time. Two standard algorithms, simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) were chosen to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method represents a considerable improvement over the other algorithms.","2021","2024-04-22 19:36:51","2024-04-22 19:36:51","","","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","deep reinforcement learning; empty-truck trips; interterminal truck routing; multiagent; truck waiting cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a successful transformation to tackle complex dimensional problems, metaheuristic algorithms have been implemented in a wide area of combinatorial optimization problems. Metaheuristic algorithms have been evolved and modified with respect to the problem nature since it was recommended for the first time. As there is a growing interest in incorporating necessary methods to develop metaheuristics, there is a need to rediscover the recent advancement of metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization. From the authors’ point of view, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys on current research directions. Therefore, a substantial part of this paper is devoted to analyzing and discussing the modern age metaheuristic algorithms that gained popular use in mostly cited combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing problems, traveling salesman problems, and supply chain network design problems. A survey of seven different metaheuristic algorithms (which are proposed after 2000) for combinatorial optimization problems is carried out in this study, apart from conventional metaheuristics like simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, and tabu search. These metaheuristics have been filtered through some key factors like easy parameter handling, the scope of hybridization as well as performance efficiency. In this study, a concise description of the framework of the selected algorithm is included. Finally, a technical analysis of the recent trends of implementation is discussed, along with the impacts of algorithm modification on performance, constraint handling strategy, the handling of multi-objective situations using hybridization, and future research opportunities.","2021","2024-04-22 19:36:52","2024-04-22 19:36:52","","","","20","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","combinatorial optimization; vehicle routing problems; constraint handling; metaheuristic optimization; supply chain design optimization; travelling salesman problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rescue of railway dangerous goods accidents should consider the timeliness of rescue, the uncertainty of traffic environment and the diversity of rescue resources. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to confront the rescue resources scheduling problem of railway dangerous goods accident by considering factors such as rescue capacity, rescue demand and response time. Based on the analysis of travel time and reliability for rescue route, a multi-objective scheduling model of rescue resources based on travel time reliability is constructed in order to minimize the total arrival time of rescue resources and to maximize total reliability. The proposed model is more reliable than the traditional model due to the consideration of travel time reliability of rescue routes. Moreover, a two-stage algorithm is designed to solve this problem. A multi-path algorithm with bound constraints is used to obtain the set of feasible rescue routes in the first stage, and the NSGA-II algorithm is used to determine the scheduling of rescue resources for each rescue center. Finally, the two-stage algorithm is tested on a regional road network, and the results show that the designed two-stage algorithm is valid for solving the rescue resource scheduling problem of dangerous goods accidents and is able to obtain the rescue resource scheduling scheme in a short period of time.","2021","2024-04-22 19:36:52","2024-04-22 19:36:52","","","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","multi-objective; NSGA-II algorithm; reliability; multi-resource scheduling; railway dangerous goods accident; rescue resource","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vocational vehicles, including garbage trucks, contribute significantly to CO2 emissions; therefore, it is strongly recommended, and in the European Union it is mandatory, to replace conventional-fuel-based garbage trucks with electric ones. For providing sustainable and energy-efficient solid waste collection with a heterogeneous fleet, in-depth mathematical computations are needed to support solving complex decision-making problems, including crew rostering and vehicle routing, because the distance and capacity of electric garbage trucks differ from conventional-fuel-based ones. However, the literature on solid waste collection using electric garbage trucks is still relatively scarce. The main contribution of this paper is developing an optimization problem for balancing travel distance assigned to each garbage truck of a heterogeneous fleet. The problem is based on specific requirements of the Municipal Solid Waste Management in Cracow, Poland, where the working time of routes is balanced and the total time of collection service can be minimized. For the problem, an MIP program was developed to generate optimal crew schedules, so that the hitherto network of segregated solid waste pickup nodes can be served using a heterogeneous fleet in which the share of electric garbage trucks is up to 30%. We study the impact of the changed composition of the fleet on modifications in crew rostering due to the shorter range of an electric vehicle compared to a conventional-fuel-based one.","2021","2024-04-22 19:36:52","2024-04-22 19:36:52","","","","21","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; vehicle routing problem; electric vehicle; crew rostering problem; e-mobility; electric garbage trucks; mix integer programming; solid waste collection; solid waste management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The care of elderly persons and general hygienic care at patients’ homes are two main reasons to motivate an optimization problem, namely, home healthcare (HHC). A robust plan for caregivers to have sustainable HHC operations management is to consider working-time balancing of caregivers, care continuity and uncertainties, e.g., the uncertainty of patients’ availability in addition to service and travel times as well as the regulations of companies to meet the standards of high-quality home care services. Based on these motivations and challenges to this field, this study firstly established a multi-objective robust optimization of the HHC which is multi-depot, multi-period and multi-service. The demand of each patient in each period may be different due to promptness of services. Each caregiver plays one of the roles of nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and nutritionists. The types of services are directly related to these roles. The objectives were optimizing the total cost of logistic activities as well as the total unemployment time of caregivers and care continuity. As a complicated optimization problem, this study innovated efficient heuristics and an enhanced nature-inspired metaheuristic. Finally, an extensive comparison with regards to the criteria of the multi-objective algorithms’ assessment was conducted.

In most cases, batch versions of the problem are considered, wherein the complete data, including customers’ geographical distribution, is well known. In real-life situations, the data change dynamically, which influences the decisions made by optimization systems. The article focuses on the aspect of geopositioning updates and their impact on the effectiveness of optimization algorithms. Such updates affect the distance matrix, one of the critical datasets used to optimize the VRP problem. A demonstration version of the optimization system was developed, wherein updates are carried out in integration with both open source routing machine and GPS tracking services. In the case of a dynamically changing list of destinations, continuous and effective updates are required. Firstly, temporary values of the distance matrix based on the correction of the quasi-Euclidean distance were generated. Next, the impact of update progress on the proposed optimization algorithms was investigated. The simulation results were compared with the results obtained “manually” by experienced planners. It was found that the upload level of the distance matrix influences the optimization effectiveness in a non-deterministic way. It was concluded that updating data should start from the smallest values in the distance matrix.","2021","2024-04-22 19:36:52","2024-04-22 19:36:52","","","","22","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; distance matrix; geopositioning; optimization system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For FJSP, by comparing the problem group with the makespan and the mean relative errors (MREs), it was found that for small-sized Kacem problems, value adjusting with “DE/rand/1” and exponential crossover at position 2. Moreover, value adjusting with “DE/best/2” and exponential crossover at position 2 gave an MRE of 3.25. For medium-sized Brandimarte problems, value adjusting with “DE/best/2” and exponential crossover at position 2 gave a mean relative error of 7.11. For large-sized Dauzere-Peres and Paulli problems, value adjusting with “DE/best/2” and exponential crossover at position 2 gave an MRE of 4.20.

The aim of the present study was to develop a multiple-vehicle system that can automatically compile a set of optimum vehicle paths, complement failed assignments, and avoid passing through no-travel zones. A heuristic algorithm was used to obtain an approximate solution within a reasonable timeline. The A* Search algorithm was adopted to determine an alternative path that does not cross the no-travel zone when the distance array was set, and an improved two-phased Tabu search was applied to converge any initial solutions into a feasible solution. A diversification strategy helped identify a global optimal solution rather than a regional one. The final experiments successfully demonstrated a group of three robot cars that were simultaneously dispatched to each of their planned routes; when any car failed during the test, its path was immediately reprogrammed by the monitoring station and passed to the other cars to continue the task until each target point had been visited.","2019","2024-04-22 19:37:15","2024-04-22 19:37:15","","","","18","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","path programming; failure complementation; robot swarm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mathematical modeling constitutes an analytical tool for the formal description of a transportation system whereby it facilitates the introduction of variables and the definition of objectives to be optimized. One of the stages of the methodology followed in the design of urban transit systems starts with the determination of corridors to optimize the population covered by the system whilst taking into account the mobility patterns of potential users and the time saved when the public network is used instead of private means of transport. Since the capture of users occurs at stations, it seems reasonable to consider an extensive and homogeneous set of candidate sites evaluated according to the parameters considered (such as pedestrian population captured and destination preferences) and to select subsets of stations so that alignments can take place. The application of optimization procedures that decide the sequence of nodes composing the alignment can produce zigzagging corridors, which are less appropriate for the design of a single line. The main aim of this work is to include a new criterion to avoid the zigzag effect when the alignment is about to be determined. For this purpose, a curvature concept for polygonal lines is introduced, and its performance is analyzed when criteria of maximizing coverage and minimizing curvature are combined in the same design algorithm. The results show the application of the mathematical model presented for a real case in the city of Seville in Spain.","2019","2024-04-22 19:37:15","2024-04-22 19:37:15","","","","18","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; network design; sustainable development goals; transport infrastructure; trip coverage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In México, there are several services that the government must provide to society for its proper development, for example, the collection of solid waste. Urban logistics include all the processes and operations that provide a service to the community, such as water, safety, health, waste collection, etc., providing the service with the lowest possible cost (economic, social, and environmental) that contributes to the sustainability of the city. Due to the accelerated growth of the world population, several environmental problems have arisen, among them, the generation of solid waste in important quantities; their proper management is relevant for adequate development of the population. The collection of solid waste in municipal areas aims to grant green spaces and recreation areas for the citizens. Although an outstanding effort has been made by the government to provide an adequate service, there are still gaps in the application of correct tools that guarantee efficiency in operations and continuity in services.

Considering the environmental protection point of view, the CCLCVRP model combines carbon emission costs with traditional waste management costs under the scenario of application of smart bins. Taking into the uncertainty of the waste generation rate, chance-constrained programming is applied to transform the uncertain model to a certain one. The initial optimal solution of this model is obtained by a proposed hybrid algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO); and then the further optimized solution is obtained by simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, due to its global optimization capability. The effectiveness of PSOSA algorithm is verified by the classic database in a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). What’s more, a case of waste collection and transportation is applied in the model for acquiring reliable conclusions, and the application of the model is tested by setting different waste fill levels (WFLs) and credibility levels. The results show that total costs rise with the increase of credibility level reflecting dispatcher’s risk preference; the WFL value range between 0.65 and 0.75 can obtain the optimal solution under different credibility levels. Finally, according to these results, some constructive proposals are propounded for the government and the logistics organization dealing with waste collection and transportation.","2020","2024-04-22 19:37:16","2024-04-22 19:37:16","","","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","carbon emissions; chance-constrained programming; smart waste bins; wet waste collection and transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the manufacturing process, some jobs in the same family are simultaneously processed as a production batch in a single machine. The batch production time depends only on the family type assigned to the production batch and it is dynamically adjusted by batch deterioration and rate-modifying activities. Each job after the batch manufacturing is reassigned to delivery batches. In the delivery process, each delivery batch is directly shipped to the corresponding customer. The delivery time of delivery batches is determined by the distance between the manufacturing site and customer location. The total volume of jobs in each production or delivery batch must not exceed the machine or truck capacity. The objective function is to minimize the total tardiness of jobs delivered to customers with different due dates. To solve the problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model to find the optimal solution for small problem instances is formulated and meta-heuristic algorithms to find effective solutions for large problem instances are presented. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to find the effect of problem parameters on the manufacturing and delivery time.","2022","2024-04-22 19:37:41","2024-04-22 19:37:41","","","","21","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","meta-heuristic algorithms; scheduling; mixed-integer linear programming; supply chain management; batch delivery; batch production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have evaluated and quantified the impact of community shuttle services on urban traffic and traffic-related air pollution. In this paper, we propose a complete framework to quantitatively assess the positive impacts of community shuttle services, including route design, traffic congestion alleviation, and air pollution reduction. During the design of community shuttle services, we developed a novel method to adaptively generate shuttle stops with maximum service capacity based on residents’ origin–destination (OD) data, and designed shuttle routes with minimum mileage by genetic algorithm. For traffic congestion alleviation, we identified trips that can be shifted to shuttle services and their potential changes in traffic flow. The decrease in traffic flow can alleviate traffic congestion and indirectly reduce unnecessary pollutant emissions. In terms of environmental protection, we utilized the COPERT III model and the spatial kernel density estimation method to finely analyze the reduction in traffic emissions by eco-friendly transportation modes to support detailed policymaking regarding transportation environmental issues. Taking Chengdu, China as the study area, the results indicate that: (1) the adaptively generated shuttle stops are more responsive to the travel demands of crowds compared with the existing bus stops; (2) shuttle services can replace 30.36% of private trips and provide convenience for 50.2% of commuters; (3) such eco-friendly transportation can reduce traffic emissions by 28.01% overall, and approximately 42% within residential areas.","2022","2024-04-22 19:37:42","2024-04-22 19:37:42","","","","22","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","big data; community shuttle services; eco-friendly transportation; origin–destination data; traffic congestion alleviation; traffic emissions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In CSA, the output of picking scheduling is the input of delivery scheduling. Hence, only by scheduling the picking stage and distribution stage in a coordinated way can we achieve fresh agricultural products at minimum cost. However, due to asymmetric information in the picking and distribution stage, the integrated scheduling of picking and distribution may lead to an asymmetric optimization problem, which is suitable for solving with an iterative algorithm. Based on this, this work studies an integrated scheduling problem of the picking and distribution of fresh agricultural products with the consideration of minimizing picking and distribution costs as well as maximizing the freshness of orders. First, a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model for the problem under consideration is constructed. Second, a multi-objective multi-population genetic algorithm with local search (MOPGA-LS) is designed. Finally, the algorithm is compared with three multi-objective optimization algorithms in the literature: the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-Ⅱ), the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition that is combined with the bee algorithm (MOEA/D-BA).

Based on the construction of a multi-stage demand forecasting model, five parts of total logistics costs: the costs of trunk transportation and regional transportation, the fixed costs of distribution center construction, the inventory holding costs, shortage costs, and salvage, are comprehensively considered. The existing CLIRP model does not consider the environmental influence. Thus, a sustainable CLIRP model considering carbon emission is established with minimum logistics costs and emission as the objective function. A heuristic algorithm gives the initial solution, and then a hybrid heuristic algorithm combining the tabu search algorithm with the simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to find the global near-optimal solution. Finally, a numerical example of a garment chain enterprise is given to illustrate the solving process of the model. The results show that using the proposed algorithm determines the optimal locations of RDCs, and the transportation routes with each region are obtained with the minimum total logistics costs and carbon emission. The model realizes the combination of location, inventory, and routing problems of the large garment enterprises and finally realizes the goal of optimizing the sustainable logistics distribution network of the garment industry, which verifies the effectiveness of the model.

An increasing number of works have thus been proposed since 2016. The authors collect the abundant specialized literature related to this novel optimization paradigm that was published in the past five years. The quantity of papers, the nationality of authors, and the important professional publications are analyzed by a statistical method. As a survey on state-of-the-art of research on this topic, this review article covers basic concepts, theoretical foundation, basic implementation approaches of MTEC, related extension issues of MTEC, and typical application fields in science and engineering. In particular, several approaches of chromosome encoding and decoding, intro-population reproduction, inter-population reproduction, and evaluation and selection are reviewed when developing an effective MTEC algorithm. A number of open challenges to date, along with promising directions that can be undertaken to help move it forward in the future, are also discussed according to the current state. The principal purpose is to provide a comprehensive review and examination of MTEC for researchers in this community, as well as promote more practitioners working in the related fields to be involved in this fascinating territory.","2021","2024-04-22 19:38:07","2024-04-22 19:38:07","","","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","evolutionary algorithm; assortative mating; knowledge transfer; multi-task evolutionary computation; multi-task optimization; unified search space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.","2021","2024-04-22 19:38:08","2024-04-22 19:38:08","","","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","hybrid methods; urban logistics; customer-centric supply chains; digital twin; emerging markets; framework; nanostores; prescriptive analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key objective of this study is to find the optimal traversal sequence of fieldwork tracks to be followed by the baler and bale retriever to minimize the non-working driving distance in the field. Two optimization processes are considered for this problem. Firstly, finding the optimal sequence of fieldwork tracks considering the constraints of the problem such as the capacity of the baler and the straw yield map of the field. Secondly, finding the optimal location and number of bales to drop in the field. A simulation model is developed to calculate all the non-productive traversal distances by baler and bale retrieval in the field. In a case study, the collected positional and temporal data from the baling process related to a sample field were considered. The output of the simulation model was compared with the conventional method applied by the operators. The results show that application of the proposed method can increase efficiency by 12.9% in comparison with the conventional method with edited data where the random movements (due to re-baling, turns in the middle of the swath, reversing, etc.) were removed from the data set.","2021","2024-04-22 19:38:08","2024-04-22 19:38:08","","","","14","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; logistics; decision support; route planning; precision agriculture; baling system; efficiency; straw collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, this paper formulates a novel multi-objective optimization model to empower companies in making optimized decisions considering the economic, environmental, and social aspects. Within the proposed model, the first objective function aims to minimize the transportation costs, processing costs, and establishment costs. The second objective function aims to minimize environmental risks and emissions related to the transportation of waste between facilities.

We define our proposed problem of a special VRP case as a combination of two hard problems: the generalized assignment and the vehicle routing problem. The different evolution (DE) algorithm is used to solve the problem. The recombination process of the original DE is modified by adding two more sets of vectors—best vector and random vector—and using two other sets—target vector and trial vector. The linear probability formula is proposed to potentially use one out of the four sets of vectors. This is called the modified DE (MDE) algorithm. Two local searches are integrated into the MDE algorithm: exchange and insert. These procedures create a DE and MDE that use (1) no local search techniques, (2) two local search techniques, (3) only the exchange procedure, and (4) only the insert procedure. This generates four DE algorithms and four MDE algorithms. The proposed methods are tested with 15 tested instances and one case study. The current procedure is compared with all proposed heuristics. The computational result shows that, in the case study, the best DE algorithm (DE-4) has a 1.6% better solution than that of the current practice, whereas the MDE algorithm is 8.2% better. The MDE algorithm that uses the same local search as the DE algorithms generates a maximum 5.814% better solution than that of the DE algorithms.","2019","2024-04-22 19:38:25","2024-04-22 19:38:25","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","local search; vehicle routing problem; insertion; assignment problem; differential evolution algorithm; drug and medical instrument sales and service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we explore the effect of demand uncertainty on the operational-level freight routing problem in the capacitated multimodal transportation network that consists of schedule-based rail transportation and time-flexible road transportation. Considering the imprecise characteristic of the demand, we adopt fuzzy set theory to model its uncertainty and use trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to represent the fuzzy demands. We set multiple transportation orders as the optimization object and employ soft time windows to reflect the customer requirement on on-time transportation. Under the above situation, we establish a fuzzy mixed integer nonlinear programming (FMINLP) model to formulate the capacitated road–rail multimodal routing problem with demand uncertainty and time windows. We first use the fuzzy expected value model and credibility measure based fuzzy chance-constrained programming to realize the defuzziness of the model and then adopt linearization technique to reformulate the crisp model to finally generate an equivalent mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can be solved by standard mathematical programming software.

The problem consists of assigning drivers to harvesters, which will then be assigned to harvest sugarcane in order to maximize daily profit. A set of drivers have various levels of experience. Therefore, a different capability to harvest sugarcane leads to a range of daily wages. Each harvester has different operating years and engine size, which affects its fuel consumption rate and capacity to harvest sugarcane, respectively. Assigning a worker to a harvester can improve the fuel consumption and efficiency of the harvester. We developed a mathematical model to reflect this problem and to solve it to find the maximum outcome using Lingo v.11 commercial optimization software. Since Lingo v.11 is limited to solving only small-size test instances, for medium to large test instances, four modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithms were used to solve the problem: MDE-1, MDE-2, MDE-3, and MDE-4. MDE-2 was found to be the best proposed heuristics because it has intensification and diversification ability. MDE has been tested with the case study. We tried to increase the daily profit by implementing three strategies: (1) change all harvesters that are more than five years old, (2) train drivers to reach maximum capacity, and (3) a combination of 1 and 2. Each strategy has a different investment. The breakeven point (number of days) to return the investment was calculated from the increase of daily profit. The computational results show that strategy 2 is the best because it has the quickest rate of investment return rate. However, this strategy has a disadvantage, since it is possible that drivers may leave the company if they have been highly trained. Moreover, strategy 1 has an acceptable break-even point at 392 days.","2019","2024-04-22 19:38:25","2024-04-22 19:38:25","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","modified differential evolution algorithm; assignment problem; generalized assignment problem; sugarcane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to simultaneously consider cost, customer satisfaction, and carbon emissions in the cold chain logistics path optimization problem, based on the idea of cost–benefit, this paper proposes a comprehensive cold chain vehicle routing problem optimization model with the objective function of minimizing the cost of unit satisfied customer. For customer satisfaction, this paper uses the punctuality of delivery as the evaluation standard. For carbon emissions, this paper introduces the carbon trading mechanism to calculate carbon emissions costs. An actual case data is used with a cycle evolutionary genetic algorithm to carry out computational experiments in the model. First, the effectiveness of the algorithm and model were verified by a numerical comparison experiment. The optimization results of the model show that increasing the total cost by a small amount can greatly improve average customer satisfaction, thereby obtaining a highly cost-effective solution. Second, the impact of carbon price on total costs, carbon emissions, and average customer satisfaction have also been numerically analyzed. The experimental results show that as carbon price increases, there are two opposite trends in total costs, depending on whether carbon quota is sufficient. Increasing carbon price within a certain range can effectively reduce carbon emissions, but at the same time it will reduce average customer satisfaction to a certain extent; there is a trade-off between carbon emissions and customer satisfaction. This model enriches the optimization research of cold chain logistics distribution, and the study results complement the impact research of carbon price on carbon emissions and customer satisfaction. Finally, some practical managerial implications for enterprises and government are offered.","2019","2024-04-22 19:38:26","2024-04-22 19:38:26","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; customer satisfaction; carbon emissions; carbon trading; cold chain logistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EVs do not produce air or noise pollution, and they have high energy efficiency and low maintenance costs. In this context, the development of efficient techniques to overcome the vehicle routing problem becomes crucial with the proliferation of EVs. The vehicle routing problem concerns the freight capacity and battery autonomy limitations in different delivery-service scenarios, and the challenge of best locating recharging stations. This work proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve the electric location routing problem with time windows (E-LRPTW) considering the state of charge, freight and battery capacities, and customer time windows in the decision model. A clustering strategy based on the k-means algorithm is proposed to divide the set of vertices (EVs) into small areas and define potential sites for recharging stations, while reducing the number of binary variables. The proposed model for E-LRPTW was implemented in Python and solved using mathematical modeling language AMPL together with CPLEX. Performed tests on instances with 5 and 10 clients showed a large reduction in the time required to find the solution (by about 60 times in one instance). It is concluded that the strategy of dividing customers by sectors has the potential to be applied and generate solutions for larger geographical areas and numbers of recharging stations, and determine recharging station locations as part of planning decisions in more realistic scenarios.","2022","2024-04-22 19:38:43","2024-04-22 19:38:43","","","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing; electric vehicles; mixed-integer linear programming; charging stations; k-means algorithm; location routing problem with time windows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Progressively, traditional combustion engine buses are being replaced by electric buses. In such cases, some stops on bus lines are equipped with charging technology. Combustion engine buses can operate for an entire day without having to refuel. By contrast, electric buses have considerably shorter ranges and need to recharge their batteries throughout a day. For cost-efficient use of electric buses, charging stations must be located within the road network so that required deadhead trips are as short as possible, but attention must also be paid to construction costs. In contrast to vehicle scheduling, which is a more short-term planning task of public transport companies, location planning of charging stations is a long-term planning problem and requires a simultaneous solving of both optimization problems. Specifically, location planning and vehicle scheduling have to be considered simultaneously in order to open up optimization potentials by comparison to sequential planning, since locations of charging stations directly influence the resulting vehicle rotations. To this purpose, we present a novel solution method for the simultaneous optimization of location planning of charging stations and vehicle scheduling for electric buses in public transport, using variable neighborhood search. By a computational study using real-world public transport data, we show that a simultaneous consideration of both problems is necessary because sequential planning generally leads to either infeasible vehicle rotations or to significant increases in costs. This is especially relevant for public transport companies that start operating electric bus fleets.","2022","2024-04-22 19:38:43","2024-04-22 19:38:43","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle scheduling; charging stations; electric buses; location planning; partial charging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The waste management system requires a critical share of city logistics optimization, especially when using cyber-physical systems. Modern tools reduce the required municipal waste handling, such as loading and unloading, transportation, and warehousing, which leads to an increase in efficiency and flexibility, saving energy and time, and protecting the environment. In this paper, we present a cyber-physical waste management system solution by providing a cyber-physical model design and description, mathematical modeling, and two cases to investigate the impact on energy consumption and emissions. After an introduction and literature review, we describe the design of the cyber-physical model and tackle the first echelon. The designed system incorporates the IoT, smart bins with multi-percentage sensors, data and information analysis, vehicles’ actual routes, energy and emissions optimization, multi-echelon systems, time windows, and flexibility. Mathematical modeling equations for the optimized total energy consumption are presented. Thirty and twenty smart bins located in VIII District in Budapest are detailed as two case studies, where solutions for the optimized real routes and energy consumption are found using three metaheuristic algorithms: genetic, particle swarm, and simulated annealing optimization algorithms. The accrued emissions of CO, NMHC, CH4, NOx, and PM for the optimized solutions are calculated. Finally, the results are compared with a random traditional solution to measure the effectiveness.","2022","2024-04-22 19:38:43","2024-04-22 19:38:43","","","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","waste management; cyber-physical system; city logistics; heuristic optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since users prefer goods to be delivered at home, one of the biggest challenges faced by e-commerce is to reduce the number of incidents that occur in the delivery of goods to the homes of customers. In many cases, these deliveries cannot take place because recipients are not at the agreed delivery point, leading to a decrease in the quality of service and an increase in distribution costs. Furthermore, sometimes the delivery policies are not in tune with the customers’ expectations. This work presents a new perspective of the last-mile logistics in the context of multichannel retail, asking customers to provide several delivery locations (at home, at work, at a familiar home, in a shop, in a locker, etc.) associated with different time windows. In addition, the customer could state their preferences about these locations. This work formulates the problem and develops different approaches to solve it. A benchmark is proposed to analyze the performance and limitations. The results reveal that a distribution policy with several locations can improve the efficiency of electronic commerce by reducing delivery costs. The findings of this study have several implications for distribution companies.","2022","2024-04-22 19:38:43","2024-04-22 19:38:43","","507-521","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing; optimization; last-mile delivery; e-commerce; priorities; quality service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an investigation of the problem of transshipment among distribution centers (DCs) in a cold supply chain to achieve sustainable inventory cross-filling. Although transshipment is an effective tool for supply chain pooling, the possibility of increased GHG emissions raises environmental concerns. This study establishes a sustainable cold-chain logistics model that considers GHG emissions from DC storage and transshipment trucks. The new sustainable cold-chain model also reflects laden status and cargo weights of trucks for accurate emission assessment. An optimization model is also developed to minimize both GHG emissions and costs in the cold chain. Numerical simulations are conducted for diverse problem cases to examine important problem characteristics. The result analysis identifies that inventory service levels and demand variability have a strong impact on GHG emissions in transshipment; small p-values in the statistical analysis verify the significance of this effect. The different effects of demand variability and service levels on each emission source are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that transshipment among DCs can effectively reduce both GHG emissions and costs in cold supply chains. This study provides useful models and tools to assess GHG emissions and optimize decisions for the design and operation of transshipment. The proposed models will enable the assessment of sustainable alternatives and achieve sustainability objectives effectively for cold supply chains.","2023","2024-04-22 19:39:09","2024-04-22 19:39:09","","","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cold chain; sustainability; carbon; cross-filling; emission; green supply chain; greenhouse gas; piecewise linear; transshipment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of experiments are conducted using concrete cube specimens, at a size of 200 mm, with a reinforcing steel bar (rebar) embedded in the center. The main variables include the water-to-cement ratio of the concrete (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), the diameter of the rebar (10 mm, 13 mm, 19 mm, and 22 mm), and the corrosion level (ranging from 0% to 20% depending on rebar diameter). The impressed current technique is used to accelerate corrosion of rebars in concrete immersed in a 3% NaCl solution. Ultrasonic pulse waves are collected from the concrete specimens using a pair of 50 kHz P-wave transducers in the through-transmission configuration before and after the accelerated corrosion test. Deep learning techniques, specifically three recurrent neural network (RNN) models (long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional long short-term memory), are utilized to develop a classification model for early detection of concrete damage due to rebar corrosion. The performance of the RNN models is compared to conventional ultrasonic testing parameters, namely ultrasonic pulse velocity and signal consistency. The results demonstrate that the RNN method outperforms the other two methods. Among the RNN methods, the bidirectional long short-term memory RNN model had the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 74% and a Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.48.

The problem is processed using Gray code and crossover and variation operations with a genetic algorithm. To improve the search accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm, an adaptive mutation method is proposed to enhance the diversity of the population and to achieve global optimal path objective finding. The improved algorithm is applied to workshop path multi-station logistics path planning, which effectively solves the transport path optimization and station solving problems in workshop logistics distribution, and the convergence speed and convergence accuracy of the algorithm are significantly improved. Finally, a simulation analysis is carried out on the optimization of the production material distribution of a smart gas meter workshop owned by K Company, which is an electronic assembly manufacturing company. We used MATLAB software for the case company logistics distribution route model for data analysis and solving. Due to the consideration of carbon emissions, we did not consider two kinds of experiments, which were two different cases of the optimal path. The experimental results verify that the distribution optimization scheduling model can meet the demands for immediate material distribution in the production workshop, which is conducive to improving material distribution efficiency, reducing logistics costs and achieving the goal of lowering carbon emissions.

The main objective of this study is to address this need by optimizing the last-mile delivery problem with service options (LMDPSOs) through a novel two-phase approach that considers various delivery options such as home delivery, self-pickup, and delivery at different prices. This original approach enables simultaneous optimization of the selection of the most appropriate pickup and delivery points and determination of the most efficient vehicle routing. The LMDPSOs reduces overall costs, minimizes environmental impact, and considers customer satisfaction levels by determining the most appropriate trips according to the available service options. This research employs a two-phase methodology for decision making. The first phase determines the value of the proposed locations through a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that incorporates sustainability criteria. In the second phase, a tailored mathematical model is proposed for vehicle routing with service options. The model is coded in the CPLEXsoftware version 12.6 in various dimensions.

Home health care is one of the newest methods of providing services to patients in developed societies that can respond to the individual lifestyle of the modern age and the increase of life expectancy. The home health care routing and scheduling problem is a generalized version of the vehicle routing problem, which is extended to a complex problem by adding special features and constraints of health care problems. In this problem, there are multiple stakeholders, such as nurses, for which an increase in their satisfaction level is very important. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to expand traditional home health care routing and scheduling models to downgrading cost aspects by adding the objective of minimizing the difference between the actual and potential skills of the nurses. Downgrading can lead to nurse dissatisfaction. In addition, skillful nurses have higher salaries, and high-level services increase equipment costs and need more expensive training and nursing certificates. Therefore, downgrading can enforce huge hidden costs to the managers of a company. To solve the bi-objective model, an ε-constraint-based approach is suggested, and the model applicability and its ability to solve the problem in various sizes are discussed. A sensitivity analysis on the Epsilon parameter is conducted to analyze the effect of this parameter on the problem.

From the literature review, most studies treat such problems as a vehicle routing problem (VRP). In those studies, repair resources are always dispatched as complete crews, and cannot be divided into smaller scales. Furthermore, each disaster point is only allowed one group of resources to recover it, without considering the possibility of accelerating the production rate subjected to specific objectives. Such limitation restricts required resources in an inflexible manner. Therefore, this study defines all repair works as an emergency repair project and adopts the framework of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP), which can resolve such complicated resource assignment issue. A novel emergency repair scheduling model for the road network is proposed based on Constraint Programming (CP) as the searching algorithm to facilitate model formulation. According to the RCPSP concepts, disaster points are set as repair activities and resource travel routes between disaster points are set as transit activities. All the repair activities are linked by transit activities and the required resources are assigned accordingly. In order to consider the second-wave hazard events of where new disaster points may occur, and new resources may be added into emergency repair projects, a rescheduling feature is integrated into the proposed model. Through two case studies, research findings show that this model can be easily modulated to adapt to different situations satisfying practical disaster management goals and solving emergency repair scheduling problems for road networks efficiently.","2021","2024-04-22 19:39:30","2024-04-22 19:39:30","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","constraint programming; emergency repair; project scheduling; rescheduling; road network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The serious game is designed to provide entertainment value by means of gamified interaction with the environment, while the crowdsensing component involves a set of roles for finding, solving and validating water-related issues. The mathematical model of distance-constrained multi-depot vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous fleet capacity is evaluated in the context of the proposed scenario, with random initial conditions given by the location of players, while the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction model provides an alternative to the centralized task allocation strategy, subject to the same evaluation method. A blockchain component based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture provides the level of trust required for achieving overall platform utility for different stakeholders in mobile crowdsensing.","2021","2024-04-22 19:39:30","2024-04-22 19:39:30","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","blockchain; gamification; mobile crowdsensing; serious gaming; urban water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several authors have attempted to summarize the current state of the art, but the literature on BSS is still scattered in different fields. Thus, there is a lack of literature that summarizes and categorizes the available research on BSS. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of the challenges behind rebalancing in bike-sharing systems. The objectives of this paper are to collect papers on the repositioning problem in dock-based bike-sharing services, classify them and point to novel research venues.

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a common discrete optimization problem in field of logistics. In the case of the base VRP, the positions of one single depot and many customers (which have product demands) are given. The vehicles and their capacity limits are also fixed in the system and the objective function is the minimization of the length of the route. In the literature, many approaches have appeared to simulate the transportation demands. Most of the approaches are using some kind of metaheuristics. Solving the problems with metaheuristics requires exploring the fitness landscape of the optimization problem. The fitness landscape analysis consists of the investigation of the following elements: the set of the possible states, the fitness function and the neighborhood relationship. We use also metaheuristics are used to perform neighborhood discovery depending on the neighborhood interpretation. In this article, the following neighborhood operators are used for the basin of attraction map: 2-opt, Order Crossover (OX), Partially Matched Crossover (PMX), Cycle Crossover (CX).

Course timetabling problems are different for different universities. The studied university course timetabling problem involves hard constraints such as classroom, class curriculum, and other variables. Concurrently, some soft constraints need also to be considered, including teacher’s preferred time, favorite class time etc. These preferences correspond to satisfaction values obtained via questionnaires. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a promising scheme for solving NP-complete problems due to its fast convergence, fewer parameter settings and ability to fit dynamic environmental characteristics. Therefore, PSO was applied towards solving course timetabling problems in this work. To reduce the computational complexity, a timeslot was designated in a particle’s encoding as the scheduling unit. Two types of PSO, the inertia weight version and constriction version, were evaluated. Moreover, an interchange heuristic was utilized to explore the neighboring solution space to improve solution quality. Additionally, schedule conflicts are handled after a solution has been generated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme of constriction PSO with interchange heuristic is able to generate satisfactory course timetables that meet the requirements of teachers and classes according to the various applied constraints.","2013","2024-04-22 19:39:53","2024-04-22 19:39:53","","227-244","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","particle swarm optimization; constriction factor; course timetabling; interchange; soft constraint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This finds a route with the smallestcarbon footprint, instead of the shortestroute distance, which is the conventional approach, to serve a number of customers with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in cases wherethere may not be only one path between each pair of customers, and the vehicle speed differs at different times of the day.

The solution representedbyour GA determines the customer serving ordering of each vehicle type. Then, the capacity check is used to classify multiple routes of each vehicle type, and the path selection determines the detailed paths of each route.

As a result, they may need to add new locations or increase the utilization of their existing center. This paper investigates the facility location problem through network space, considering traversable truck roads, thereby providing a strategic decision for identifying a depot location in consideration of vehicle routings from a real application. For the analysis, a geospatial tool, which is embedded in the commercial software ArcMap®, was used for routing and calibrating the model. Ten candidates from commercial and industrial zones in the cities of Fargo, West Fargo, and Moorhead were considered for future distribution centers. The candidate locations were analyzed to determine which site minimizes the total transportation costs and travel miles in consideration of time window, vehicle capacity, heterogeneous vehicle types, land use plan, and hours-of-service. Most attractive candidates are close to the intersections of major highways. From the analysis, the study recommends locating a distribution center at three alternatives based on the average ranking method. This study can be used by distributors as they consider new locations and extra depots to support strategic planning to deal with mid-term and long-term growth of demand in beverage markets.

The proposed problem is composed of two stages of assignment: (1) different types of trucks are assigned to chicken farms to transport young chickens to egg farms, and (2) chicken farms are assigned to egg farms. Assigning different trucks to the egg farms and different egg farms to the chicken farms generates different costs and consumes different resources. The distance and the idle space in the truck have to be minimized, while constraints such as the minimum number of chickens needed for all egg farms and the longest time that chickens can be in the truck remain. This makes the problem a special case of the multistage assignment (S-MSA) problem. A mathematical model representing the problem was developed and solved to optimality using Lingo v.11 optimization software. Lingo v.11 can solve to optimality only small- and medium-sized test instances. To solve large-sized test instances, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm was designed. An excellent decoding method was developed to increase the search performance of DE. The proposed algorithm was tested with three randomly generated datasets (small, medium, and large test instances) and one real case study. Each dataset is composed of 12 problems, therefore we tested with 37 instances, including the case study. The results show that for small- and medium-sized test instances, DE has 0.03% and 0.05% higher cost than Lingo v.11. For large test instances, DE has 3.52% lower cost than Lingo v.11. Lingo v.11 uses an average computation time of 5.8, 103, and 4320 s for small, medium and large test instances, while DE uses 0.86, 1.68, and 8.79 s, which is, at most, 491 times less than Lingo v.11.

Simultaneously, customer satisfaction improvement has always been a goal of businesses. It is recognized that efficient technologies and advanced methods can help transportation companies find a better balance between progress in energy saving and customer satisfaction. This paper investigates a bi-objective vehicle-routing problem with soft time windows and multiple depots, which aims to simultaneously minimize total energy consumption and customer dissatisfaction. To address the problem, we first develop mixed-integer programming. Then, an augmented ϵ -constraint method is adopted to obtain the optimal Pareto front for small problems. It is very time consuming for the augmented ϵ -constraint method to precisely solve even medium-sized problems. For medium- and large-sized problems, two Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based heuristics with different rules for generating initial solutions and offspring are designed. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated by 100 randomly generated instances. Computational results show that the second NSGA-II-based heuristic is highly effective in finding approximate non-dominated solutions for small-size and medium-size instances, and the first one is performs better for the large-size instances.","2018","2024-04-22 19:40:23","2024-04-22 19:40:23","","","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","customer satisfaction; augmented ϵ-constraint method; bi-objective vehicle-routing problem; energy saving; NSGA-II-based heuristic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.","An Enhanced Approach for the Multiple Vehicle Routing Problem with Heterogeneous Vehicles and a Soft Time Window","Symmetry","","2073-8994","10.3390/sym10110650","","The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. This research focuses on the problem under which a manufacturer needs to outsource materials from other suppliers and to ship the materials back to the company. Heterogeneous vehicles are available to ship the materials, and each vehicle has a limited loading capacity and a limited travelling distance. The purpose of this research is to study a multiple vehicle routing problem (MVRP) with soft time window and heterogeneous vehicles. Two models, using mixed integer programming (MIP) and genetic algorithm (GA), are developed to solve the problem. The MIP model is first constructed to minimize the total transportation cost, which includes the assignment cost, travelling cost, and the tardiness cost, for the manufacturer. The optimal solution can present multiple vehicle routing and the loading size of each vehicle in each period. The GA is next applied to solve the problem so that a near-optimal solution can be obtained when the problem is too difficult to be solved using the MIP. A case of a food manufacturing company is used to examine the practicality of the proposed MIP model and the GA model. The results show that the MIP model can obtain the optimal solution under a short computational time when the scale of the problem is small. When the problem becomes non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard), the MIP model cannot find the optimal solution. On the other hand, the GA model can obtain a near-optimal solution within a reasonable amount of computational time. This paper is related to several important topics of the Symmetry journal in the areas of mathematics and computer science theory and methods. In the area of mathematics, the theories of linear and non-linear algebraic structures and information technology are adopted. In the area of computer science, theory and methods, and metaheuristics are applied.","2018","2024-04-22 19:40:24","2024-04-22 19:40:24","","","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing; genetic algorithm (GA); heterogeneous vehicles; mixed integer programming (MIP); soft time window","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these environments, cooperative strategies can be effectively exploited when flying in GNSS-challenging conditions, e.g., natural/urban canyons, while the different UAVs can fly as independent systems in the absence of navigation issues (i.e., open sky conditions). These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs. Path planning, formulated as a vehicle routing problem, aims at defining smooth and flyable polynomial trajectories, whose time of flight is estimated to guarantee coexistence of different UAVs at the same challenging area. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment directly derived from a real-world 3D scenario, for variable number of UAVs and waypoints. Its solution and computational cost are compared with optimal planning methods. Results show that the computational burden is almost unaffected by the number of UAVs, and it is compatible with near real time implementation even for a relatively large number of waypoints. The provided solution takes full advantage from the available flight resources, reducing mission time for a given set of waypoints and for increasing UAV number.","2018","2024-04-22 19:40:24","2024-04-22 19:40:24","","","","12","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cooperative navigation; GNSS-challenging environment; insertion-based techniques; multi-UAV path planning; polynomial path","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the distribution activities have a non-negligible impact on the environment, as well as on the citizens’ welfare. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) aims at designing routes that minimize the cost of serving customers using a given set of capacitated vehicles. Some VRP variants consider traveling times, either in the objective function (e.g., including the goal of minimizing total traveling time or designing balanced routes) or as constraints (e.g., the setting of time windows or a maximum time per route). Typically, the traveling time between two customers or between one customer and the depot is assumed to be both known in advance and static. However, in real life, there are plenty of factors (predictable or not) that may affect these traveling times, e.g., traffic jams, accidents, road works, or even the weather. In this work, we analyze the VRP with dynamic traveling times. Our work assumes not only that these inputs are dynamic in nature, but also that they are a function of the structure of the emerging routing plan. In other words, these traveling times need to be dynamically re-evaluated as the solution is being constructed. In order to solve this dynamic optimization problem, a learnheuristic-based approach is proposed. Our approach integrates statistical learning techniques within a metaheuristic framework. A number of computational experiments are carried out in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness.","2018","2024-04-22 19:40:24","2024-04-22 19:40:24","","","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; dynamic traveling times; learnheuristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this paper aims to formulate and solve a Put-away Routing Problem (PRP) in distribution centres (DCs). This PRP formulation represents a novel approach due to the consideration of a fleet of homogeneous Material Handling Equipment (MHE), heterogeneous products linked to a put-away list size, depot location and multi-parallel aisles in a distribution centre. It should be noted that the slotting problem, rather than the PRP, has usually been studied in the literature, whereas the PRP is addressed in this paper. The PRP is solved using a discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm that is compared to tabu search approaches (Classical Tabu Search (CTS), Tabu Search (TS) 2-Opt) and an empirical rule. As a result, it was found that a discrete PSO generates the best solutions, as the time savings range from 2 to 13% relative to CTS and TS 2-Opt for different combinations of factor levels evaluated in the experimentation.","2020","2024-04-22 19:40:50","2024-04-22 19:40:50","","","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","discrete particle swarm optimization; distribution centre; order picking; put-away routing; warehouse management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main feature of the studied system is performing transshipment of cargo between mother and daughter vessels at appropriate locations at sea. This operation requires synchronization between both types of vessels as they have to meet at the same location at the same time. This paper studies the problem of designing a synchronized feeder network, explicitly accounting for the effect of uncertain travel times caused by harsh weather conditions. We propose an optimization-simulation framework to find robust solutions for the transportation system. The optimization model finds optimal routes that are then evaluated by a discrete-even simulation model to measure their robustness under uncertain weather conditions. This process of optimization simulation is repeated until a satisfactory condition is reached. To find even better solutions, we include different performance-improving strategies by adding robustness during route generation or exploiting flexibility in sailing speed to recover from delays. We apply the solution method to a case based on realistic data from a Norwegian shipping company. The results show that the method finds near-optimal solutions that offer robustness against schedule perturbations due to harsh weather.

In this paper, the focus was on developing a dynamic route-planning system for automated guided vehicles within a warehouse. A dynamic routing problem with real-time obstacles was considered in this research. A key problem in this research area is the lack of a real-time route-planning algorithm that is suitable for the implementation on automated guided vehicles with limited computing resources. An optimization model, as well as machine learning methodologies for determining an operational route for the problem, is proposed. An internal layout of the warehouse of a large consumer product distributor was used to test the performance of the methodologies. A simulation environment based on Gazebo was developed and used for testing the implementation of the route-planning system. Computational results show that the proposed machine learning methodologies were able to generate routes with testing accuracy of up to 98% for a practical internal layout of a warehouse with 18 storage racks and 67 path segments.

Consequently, the transportation of refrigerated food is becoming a crucial aspect of the chain, aiming at ensuring efficiency and sustainability of the process while keeping a high level of product quality. The recently defined Refrigerated Routing Problem (RRP) consists of finding the optimal delivery tour that minimises the fuel consumption for both the traction and the refrigeration components. The total fuel consumption is related, in a complex way, to the distance travelled, the vehicle load and speed, and the outdoor temperature. All these factors depend, in turn, on the traffic and the climate conditions of the region where deliveries take place and they change during the day and the year. The original RRP has been extended to take into account also the total driving cost and to add the possibility to slow down the deliveries by allowing arbitrarily long waiting times when this is beneficial for the objective function. The new RRP is formulated and solved as both a Mixed Integer Programming and a novel Constraint Programming model. Moreover, a Local Search metaheuristic technique (namely Late Acceptance Hill Climbing), based on a combination of different neighborhood structures, is also proposed.

One of the rising concerns in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is solid waste management, especially in Makkah. The Solid Waste Collection Problem (SWCP) refers to the route optimisation of waste collection trucks visiting containers across various locations. Manually generated routes might contain some mistakes, and constructing and revising designed solutions can take a long time. Thus, there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions to this problem. Solving this problem demands tackling numerous routing constraints while aiming to minimise the operational cost. Since solid waste has a significant impact on the environment, reducing fuel consumption must be an objective. Methods: Thus, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed in this paper while using the time-oriented nearest neighbour heuristic. The goal is to investigate their performance on nine existing instances of SWCP in the city of Makkah. The proposed model is implemented in the Gurobi solver. The time-oriented nearest neighbour heuristic constructs the initial solution and is then re-optimised using Google OR-tools. Results: Using the greedy method to construct a solution for this problem generated better solutions when compared to the results obtained without the greedy method.

However, there are still shortcomings of convergence speed and local optimization in this algorithm. This paper proposes a metaheuristic algorithm for continuous and constrained global optimization problems, which combines the MOA, the Aquila Optimizer (AO), and the opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy, called AOBLMOA, to overcome the shortcomings of the MOA. The proposed algorithm first fuses the high soar with vertical stoop method and the low flight with slow descent attack method in the AO into the position movement process of the male mayfly population in the MOA. Then, it incorporates the contour flight with short glide attack and the walk and grab prey methods in the AO into the positional movement of female mayfly populations in the MOA. Finally, it replaces the gene mutation behavior of offspring mayfly populations in the MOA with the OBL strategy. To verify the optimization ability of the new algorithm, we conduct three sets of experiments. In the first experiment, we apply AOBLMOA to 19 benchmark functions to test whether it is the optimal strategy among multiple combined strategies. In the second experiment, we test AOBLMOA by using 30 CEC2017 numerical optimization problems and compare it with state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. In the third experiment, 10 CEC2020 real-world constrained optimization problems are used to demonstrate the applicability of AOBLMOA to engineering design problems.

This paper considers a truck routing problem within a naval port, where the objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the vehicles to distribute a given set of containers. Due to the large volume of goods that are being transferred through ports, it is imperative to improve the operation times at such ports to improve the throughput. To achieve this goal, a novel variable neighborhood search method that integrates a tabu list, an iterative local search procedure, and parallelization of neighborhood generation is proposed and evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves similar results to the state of the art, but in a smaller amount of time.","2023","2024-04-22 19:41:15","2024-04-22 19:41:15","","","","17","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","metaheuristics; vehicle routing problem; variable neighborhood search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting from the perspective of considering the green cost, by constructing a distribution path optimization model of fresh cold chain products considering green cost with the optimal total distribution cost as the research objective, energy saving and emission reduction are integrated into the path optimization problem so that we can explore how to protect the environment while realizing the benefits of the enterprise, and the model is solved by using the ant colony algorithm. By observing the cold chain logistics distribution path arrangement before and after optimization, it is found that the fresh cold chain product distribution path optimization considering green cost can effectively reduce the transportation cost, refrigeration cost, carbon emission cost, and cargo damage cost in the distribution process. Under the optimal distribution strategy, the total cost is reduced by about 16.6% compared to the original route, and the environmental cost is reduced while reducing the distribution cost. It shows that this strategy can improve transportation efficiency and customer satisfaction while saving resources and protecting the environment. And this study comprehensively considers the actual operation of logistics enterprises, so this study has a certain significance of reference value for the green transformation of enterprises.

This study presents the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Delivery Options (CVRPDO), which includes locker delivery.

Many studies have proposed non-iterative heuristic construction algorithms and iterative meta-heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. However, the heuristic construction algorithms spend a relatively shorter time at the expense of solution quality, while the iterative meta-heuristic algorithms accomplish a high-quality solution with a lot of time. To overcome the shortcomings of these approaches and efficiently utilize the historical scheduling information and task characteristics, this paper introduces a new neural network model based on the deep reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithm (DRL-HA) to the AEOSSP and proposes an innovative non-iterative heuristic algorithm. The DRL-HA is composed of a heuristic construction neural network (HCNN) model and a task arrangement algorithm (TAA), where the HCNN aims to generate the task planning sequence and the TAA generates the final feasible scheduling order of tasks. In this study, the DRL-HA is examined with other heuristic algorithms by a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the DRL-HA outperforms competitors and HCNN possesses outstanding generalization ability for different scenario sizes and task distributions. Furthermore, HCNN, when used for generating initial solutions of meta-heuristic algorithms, can achieve improved profits and accelerate interactions. Therefore, the DRL-HA algorithm is verified to be an effective method for solving AEOSSP. In this way, the high-profit and high-timeliness of agile satellite scheduling can be guaranteed, and the solution of AEOSSP is further explored and improved.","2022","2024-04-22 19:41:41","2024-04-22 19:41:41","","","","19","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","deep reinforcement learning; agile satellite scheduling; heuristic construction neural network; task arrangement algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, the maximum distance that each vehicle can cover is limited. Alternatively, there is a threshold for the maximum time a vehicle can employ before reaching its destination. Due to this driving range constraint, not all potential nodes offering rewards can be visited. Hence, the typical goal is to maximize the total reward collected without exceeding the vehicle’s capacity. The TOP can be used to model operations related to fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles, road electric vehicles with limited driving range, or ride-sharing operations in which the vehicle has to reach its destination on or before a certain deadline. However, in some realistic scenarios, travel times are better modeled as random variables, which introduce additional challenges into the problem. This paper analyzes a stochastic version of the team orienteering problem in which random delays are considered. Being a stochastic environment, we are interested in generating solutions with a high expected reward that, at the same time, are highly reliable (i.e., offer a high probability of not suffering any route delay larger than a user-defined threshold). In order to tackle this stochastic optimization problem, which contains a probabilistic constraint on the random delays, we propose an extended simheuristic algorithm that also employs concepts from reliability analysis.","2022","2024-04-22 19:41:41","2024-04-22 19:41:41","","","","20","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","simheuristics; team orienteering problem; probabilistic constraints; reliability analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, the framework of the emergency material delivery system (EMDS) with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the vehicle is proposed, and the problem is modeled into a multi-trip time-dependent dynamic vehicle routing problem with split-delivery (MTTDDVRP-SD) in combination with the rescue reality, which provides decision support for planning disaster relief material. Due to the universality of dynamic interference in the process of material delivery, an optimization algorithm based on the traditional intelligent auction mechanism is proposed to avoid system performance degradation or even collapse. The algorithm adds pre-authorization and sequential auction mechanisms to the traditional auction mechanism, where the pre-authorization mechanism improves the capability performance of the system when there is no interference during the rescue process and the sequential auction mechanism improves the resilience performance of the system when it faces interferences. Finally, considering three types of interference comprehensively, which includes new task generations, task unexpected changes and UAV’s number decreases, the proposed algorithm is compared with DTAP (DTA based on sequential single item auctions) and CBBA-PR (consensus-based bundle algorithms-partial replanning) algorithms under different dynamic interference intensity scenarios for simulation experimental from two perspectives of the capability performance and resilience performance. The results of Friedman’s test with 99% confidence interval indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the capability performance and resilience performance of EMDS.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:09","2024-04-22 19:42:09","","","","13","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DVRP; emergency material delivery; MTVRP; pre-authorization mechanism; resilience; SDVRP; sequential auction mechanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, the analysis of complex systems in these non-deterministic environments is approached with simulation techniques. However, simulation is not an optimization tool. Hence, it must be combined with optimization methods when our goal is to: (i) minimize operating costs while guaranteeing a given quality of service; or (ii) maximize system performance using limited resources. When solving NP-hard optimization problems, the use of metaheuristics allows us to deal with large-scale instances in reasonable computation times. By adding a simulation layer to the metaheuristics, the methodology becomes a simheuristic, which allows the optimization element to solve scenarios under uncertainty. Methods: This paper reviews the indexed documents in Elsevier Scopus database of both initial as well as recent applications of simheuristics in the logistics and transportation field. The paper also discusses open research lines in this knowledge area. Results: The simheuristics approaches to solving NP-hard and large-scale combinatorial optimization problems under uncertainty scenarios are discussed, as they frequently appear in real-life applications in logistics and transportation activities. Conclusions: The way in which the different simheuristic components interact puts a special emphasis in the different stages that can contribute to make the approach more efficient from a computational perspective.

The MVRP is to find a set of routes by multiple vehicles that serve multiple customers at a minimal total cost while the travelling-time delay due to traffic congestion is tolerated. It is an NP problem and is conventionally solved by metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms. For the MVRP in a distribution network, we propose an optimal distribution path optimization method that is composed of a distribution sequence search stage and a distribution path search stage that exploits a divide-and-conquer strategy, inspired by the idea of dynamic programming. Several optimization objectives subject to constraints are defined. The search for the optimal solution of the number of distribution vehicles, distribution sequence, and path is implemented by using an improved genetic algorithm (GA), which is characterized by an operation for preprocessing infeasible solutions, an elitist’s strategy, a sequence-related two-point crossover operator, and a reversion mutation operator. The improved GA outperforms the simple GA in terms of total cost, route topology, and route feasibility. The proposed method can help to reduce costs and increase efficiency for logistics and transportation enterprises and can also be used for flow-shop scheduling by manufacturing enterprises.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:09","2024-04-22 19:42:09","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; dynamic programming; divide-and-conquer strategy; improved genetic algorithm; multivehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike the traditional retail shopping model, e-commerce must deliver custom orders to highly dispersed locations. Consequently, negative effects have been observed in large urban and densely populated areas, such as congestion and pollution. Pick-up points (PPs) are fast-growing solutions that provide parcel delivery and picking services at diverse locations throughout major city centers. This paper describes an optimization-based approach aimed to investigate the conditions in which a network of pick-up points can be more efficient than home deliveries from operational and environmental points of view in urban last-mile distribution. Differently from the related literature, in which analytical models were employed, we use optimization and algorithms to determine the economic and environmental benefits of packages destined for pick-up points instead of home deliveries. The framework was applied to the city of São Paulo, in Brazil. Several scenarios were evaluated, comprising different densities and percentages of deliveries destined for PPs. The results show that PPs can be a promising alternative for reducing the environmental externalities, as fleet and vehicle mileage can be reduced by more than 50%.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:10","2024-04-22 19:42:10","","","","14","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-commerce; last-mile distribution; pick-up points","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to propose an accurate travel-time estimation model. The model was developed by considering the different multiple traffic modes through a continuous approach. Moreover, in this model, it was assumed that the route between two nodes was a combination of different segments (i.e., expressway, boulevard, main street, auxiliary street, alley, etc.), and the speed level varied along the route and depended on the segments of the route. Congestion is a key factor affecting the delivery time of food to customers. To assess the reliability of the model, data from the delivery and sales network of the oldest and biggest beverage manufacturer in Iran was used. A new congestion pattern was identified based on the analysis of 272 routes and several rules were described that proved the above assumption about congestion.

Numerous metropolitan management organizations hope to promote the coordination of traffic and urban development by formulating and improving traffic development strategies. The effectiveness of these solutions depends largely on an accurate assessment of the distribution of urban hotspots (centers of traffic activity). In recent years, many scholars have employed the K-Means clustering technique to identify urban hotspots, believing it to be efficient. K-means clustering is a sort of iterative clustering analysis. When the data dimensionality is large and the sample size is enormous, the K-Means clustering algorithm is sensitive to the initial clustering centers. To mitigate the problem, a hybrid heuristic “fuzzy system-particle swarm-genetic” algorithm, named FPSO-GAK, is employed to obtain better initial clustering centers for the K-Means clustering algorithm. The clustering results are evaluated and analyzed using three-cluster evaluation indexes (SC, SP and SSE) and two-cluster similarity indexes (CI and CSI). A taxi GPS dataset and a multi-source dataset were employed to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the Random Swap clustering algorithm (RS), Genetic K-means algorithm (GAK), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based K-Means, PSO based constraint K-Means, PSO based Weighted K-Means, PSO-GA based K-Means and K-Means++ algorithms. The comparison findings demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better clustering results, as well as successfully acquire urban hotspots.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:10","2024-04-22 19:42:10","","","","16","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","genetic algorithm; K-means clustering; particle swarm optimization; fuzzy system; taxi GPS data; urban hotspots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The number of areas for their practical applications is rapidly growing. The most promising are: last-mile delivery, emergency response, the inspection of technical devices and installations, etc. In these applications, it is often necessary to solve vehicle routing problems, formulated as a variant of the vehicle routing problems with drones (VRPD). This study presents a proactive approach to a modified and extended VRPD, including: the dynamic selection of drone take-off points, bidirectional delivery (delivery and pick up), various types of shipments, allocation of shipments to drones and drones to vehicles, the selection of the optimal number of drones, etc. Moreover, a formal model of constraints and questions for the extended vehicle routing problem with drones (EVRPD) and exact and approximate methods for solving it have been proposed. The proposed model can be the basis for supporting proactive and reactive decisions regarding last-mile delivery, particularly the selection of the necessary fleet, starting points, the identification of specific shipments that prevent delivery with available resources, etc. The study also includes the results of numerous computational experiments verifying the effectiveness of the implementation methods. The time to obtain a solution is at least 20 times shorter for the proposed DGA (dedicated genetic algorithm) than for the mathematical programming solvers such as Gurobi or LINGO.

A coverage path planning method mitigating the optimisation and automation of harvest operations, characterised by capacity limitations and features derived from real world scenarios, is presented. Although prior research has developed similar methods, no such methodologies have been developed for (i) multiple field entrances as line segments, (ii) the feasibility of stationary and on-the-go unloading in the headland and main field, (iii) unloading timing independent of the full bin level of the harvester, and (iv) the transport unit operational time outside the field. To find the permutation that best minimises the costs in time and distance, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was used as a meta-heuristic optimisation method. The effectiveness of the method was analysed by generating simulated operational data and by comparing it to recorded data from seven fields ranging in size (5–26 ha) and shape. The implementation of controlled traffic farming (CTF) in the coverage path planning method, but not with the recorded data, resulted in a reduced risk of soil compaction of up to 25%, and a reduction in the in-field total travel distance of up to 15% when logistics was optimised simultaneously for two transport units. A 68% increase in the full load frequency of transporting vehicles and a 14% reduction in the total number of field to storage transports was observed. For fields located at outermost edges of the storage facility (>5 km), the increase in full load frequency, average load level, and decrease in in-field travel distance resulted in a reduction in fuel consumption by 7%. Embedding the developed coverage path planning software as a service will improve the sustainability of harvest operations including a fleet of one to many harvesting and transporting units, as the system in front of the vehicle operator calculates and displays all required actions from the operator.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:44","2024-04-22 19:42:44","","","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","coverage path planning; agricultural field operations optimisation; artificial bee colony; capacitated arc routing problem; fleet management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The supply chain comprises a set of suppliers delivering their products loaded on RTIs to a set of customers. RTIs are of various types. The objective is to model a deterministic, multi-supplier, multi-customer inventory routing problem with pickup and delivery of multi-RTI. The model includes inventory-level constraints, the availability of empty RTIs to suppliers, and the minimisation of the total cost, including inventory holding, screening, maintenance, transportation, sharing, and purchasing costs for new RTIs. Furthermore, suppliers with common customers coordinate to virtually pool their inventory of empty RTIs held by customers so that, when loaded RTIs are delivered to customers, each may benefit from this visit to pick up the empty RTI, regardless of the ownership. To handle the combinatorial complexity of the model, a new artificial-immune-system-based algorithm coupled with deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The algorithm combines artificial immune systems’ strong global search ability and a strong self-adaptability ability into a goal-driven performance enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, all tailored to the suggested mathematical model. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances highlight the performance of the proposed approach. From a managerial point of view, the results stress that this new approach allows for economies of scale and cost reduction at the level of all involved parties to about 40%. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on the unit cost of transportation and the procurement of new RTIs is conducted, highlighting the benefits and limits of the proposed model compared to dedicated and physical pooling modes.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:44","2024-04-22 19:42:44","","","","10","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","deep reinforcement learning; pickup and delivery; artificial immune systems; closed loop supply chain; inventory routing problem; returnable transport items","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The delivery routes should be adjusted for the new customer demands as soon as possible when new customer demands emerge. This study investigates a collaborative multidepot vehicle routing problem with dynamic customer demands and time windows (CMVRPDCDTW) by considering resource sharing and dynamic customer demands. Resource sharing of multidepot across multiple service periods can maximize logistics resource utilization and improve the operating efficiency of delivery logistics networks. A bi-objective optimization model is constructed to optimize the vehicle routes while minimizing the total operating cost and number of vehicles. A hybrid algorithm composed of the improved k-medoids clustering algorithm and improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization based on the dynamic insertion strategy (IMOPSO-DIS) algorithm is designed to find near-optimal solutions for the proposed problem. The improved k-medoids clustering algorithm assigns customers to depots in terms of specific distances to obtain the clustering units, whereas the IMOPSO-DIS algorithm optimizes vehicle routes for each clustering unit by updating the external archive. The elite learning strategy and dynamic insertion strategy are applied to maintain the diversity of the swarm and enhance the search ability in the dynamic environment. The experiment results with 26 instances show that the performance of IMOPSO-DIS is superior to the performance of multiobjective particle swarm optimization, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, and multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. A case study in Chongqing City, China is implemented, and the related results are analyzed. This study provides efficient optimization strategies to solve CMVRPDCDTW. The results reveal a 32.5% reduction in total operating costs and savings of 29 delivery vehicles after optimization. It can also improve the intelligence level of the distribution logistics network, promote the sustainable development of urban logistics and transportation systems, and has meaningful implications for enterprises and government to provide theoretical and decision supports in economic and social development.","2022","2024-04-22 19:42:45","2024-04-22 19:42:45","","","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","collaborative network; dynamic customer demands; IMOPSO-DIS algorithm; multidepot vehicle routing problem with time windows; resource sharing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With an increase in urban population that is set to grow even faster in the future, smart city development has been the main goal for governments worldwide. In this regard, while the useage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques covering the areas of Machine and Deep Learning have garnered much attention for Smart Cities, less attention has focused towards the use of combinatorial optimization schemes. To help with this, the current review presents a coverage of optimization methods and applications from a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT). A mapping is provided for the most encountered applications of computational optimization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization methods, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony optimization and differential evolution. For each application identified, the algorithms used, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation and constraints taken in to account have been specified and discussed. Lastly, the data setup used by each covered work is also mentioned and directions for future work have been identified.

In optimisation problems, the location of the global optimum solution is unknown a priori, and initialisation is a stochastic process. In addition, the population size is equally important; if there are problems with high dimensions, a small population size may lie sparsely in unpromising regions, and may return suboptimal solutions with bias. In addition, the different distributions used as position vectors for the initial population may have different sampling emphasis; hence, different degrees of diversity. The initialisation control parameters of population-based metaheuristic algorithms play a significant role in improving the performance of the algorithms. Researchers have identified this significance, and they have put much effort into finding various distribution schemes that will enhance the diversity of the initial populations of the algorithms, and obtain the correct balance of the population size and number of iterations which will guarantee optimal solutions for a given problem set. Despite the affirmation of the role initialisation plays, to our knowledge few studies or surveys have been conducted on this subject area. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of different initialisation schemes to improve the quality of solutions obtained by most metaheuristic optimisers for a given problem set. Popular schemes used to improve the diversity of the population can be categorised into random numbers, quasirandom sequences, chaos theory, probability distributions, hybrids of other heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms, Lévy, and others. We discuss the different levels of success of these schemes and identify their limitations. Similarly, we identify gaps and present useful insights for future research directions. Finally, we present a comparison of the effect of population size, the maximum number of iterations, and ten (10) different initialisation methods on the performance of three (3) population-based metaheuristic optimizers: bat algorithm (BA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA).","2022","2024-04-22 19:43:06","2024-04-22 19:43:06","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","metaheuristics; initialisation; metaheuristics optimisers; population size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adoption of multi-echelon distribution networks and the use of environmentally friendly vehicles in freight distribution have become major concepts for reducing the negative impact of urban transportation activities. In this line, the present paper proposes a two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem. In the first echelon of the distribution network, products are transported from central warehouses to satellites located in the surroundings of cities. This is achieved by means of large conventional trucks. Subsequently, relatively smaller-sized electric vehicles distribute these products from the satellites to demand points/customers located in the cities. The proposed problem also takes into account the limited driving range of electric vehicles that need to be recharged at charging stations when necessary. In addition, the proposed problem considers time window constraints for the delivery of products to customers. A mixed-integer linear programming formulation is developed and small-sized instances are solved using CPLEX. Furthermore, we propose a constructive heuristic based on a modified Clarke and Wright savings heuristic. The solutions of this heuristic serve as initial solutions for a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic. The numerical results show that the variable neighborhood search matches CPLEX in the context of small problems. Moreover, it consistently outperforms CPLEX with the growing size and difficulty of problem instances.","2022","2024-04-22 19:43:07","2024-04-22 19:43:07","","","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","routing; variable neighborhood search; large neighborhood search; Clarke and Wright savings; two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the non-contact nature of robots effectively helped with preventing the spread of the epidemic. Task allocation and path planning according to actual problems is one of the most important problems faced by robots in intelligent logistics. In the distribution, the robots have the fundamental characteristics of battery capacity limitation, limited load capacity, and load affecting transportation capacity. So, a smart community logistics service framework is proposed based on control system, automatic replenishment platform, network communication method, and coordinated distribution optimization technology, and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed for the collaborative and persistent delivery of a multiple-depot vehicle routing problem with time window (MDVRPTW) of swarm robots. In order to solve this problem, a hybrid algorithm of genetically improved set-based particle swarm optimization (S-GAIPSO) is designed and tested with numerical cases. Experimental results show that, Compared to CPLEX, S-GAIPSO has achieved gaps of 0.157%, 1.097%, and 2.077% on average, respectively, when there are 5, 10, and 20 tasks. S-GAIPSO can obtain the optimal or near-optimal solution in less than 0.35 s, and the required CPU time slowly increases as the scale increases.

There are numerous studies in the literature addressing environmental problems from the point of view of efficient planning that allows visualizing the benefits associated with the use of the new technologies in electric vehicles. This paper focuses on the electric vehicle routing problem and considers the batteries’ state of charge (SoC). The problem considers a set of customers, where each one has a specific demand and a time window. Deliveries are performed through a homogeneous fleet of electric vehicles with a fixed charging capacity and limited autonomy. In particular, when the vehicle is traveling, it consumes an amount of energy proportional to the distance it travels; therefore, it must visit battery recharging stations to continue and complete its route. The objective is to determine the performed routes with the minimum cost (time), while seeking to visit the recharging stations as many times as possible. In this way, overcharging and deep discharges are avoided by protecting the battery from degradation. In this paper, four models are proposed: the first model requires that the battery be fully charged in the stations; the second model allows partial recharging; the third formulation limits deep discharge; and a fourth formulation adheres to a limitation associated with overcharging and tries to keep the battery in its most comfortable place. The efficiency of the proposed formulations is tested in structured instances of different sizes. The results obtained show the efficiency of the formulations proposed for the electric vehicle routing problem when considering battery degradation.","2022","2024-04-22 19:43:07","2024-04-22 19:43:07","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","electric vehicles; optimization; state of charge; batteries charge; road transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the exponential computational time of the exact resolution, an evolutionary descent method is developed. It relies on a new operator for perturbing the search.

Within this process, assessment teams should compromise between the two conflicting objectives of a “faster” assessment, which covers the needs of fewer community groups, and a “better” assessment, i.e., covering more community groups over a longer time. Moreover, due to the possible effect of the disaster on the transportation network, assessment teams need to make their field-visit planning decisions under travel-time uncertainty. This study considers the two objectives of minimizing the total route duration and maximizing the coverage ratio of community groups, as well as the uncertainty of travel times, during the rapid needs assessment stage. In particular, within our bi-objective solution approach, we provide the set of non-dominated solutions that differ in terms of total route duration and the vector of community coverage ratio at different levels of travel-time uncertainty. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of the amount of violation of maximum allowed time for decision makers to see the trade-offs between infeasibility and solution quality. We apply the robust optimization approach to tackle travel-time uncertainty due to its advantages in requiring fewer data for uncertain parameters and immunizing a feasible solution under all possible realizations.","2022","2024-04-22 19:43:07","2024-04-22 19:43:07","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","multi-objective; robust optimization; humanitarian needs assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate efficient observation of high-altitude airships (HAA), a high-quality observation scheduling approach is crucial. This paper considers the scheduling of the imaging sensor and proposes a hierarchical observation scheduling approach based on task clustering (SA-TC). The original observation scheduling problem of HAA is transformed into three sub-problems (i.e., task clustering, sensor scheduling, and cruise path planning) and these sub-problems are respectively solved by three stages of the proposed SA-TC. Specifically, a novel heuristic algorithm integrating an improved ant colony optimization and the backtracking strategy is proposed to address the task clustering problem. The 2-opt local search is embedded into a heuristic algorithm to solve the sensor scheduling problem and the improved ant colony optimization is also implemented to solve the cruise path planning problem. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the three algorithms for solving the three sub-problems are further analyzed on instances with different scales.","2022","2024-04-22 19:43:08","2024-04-22 19:43:08","","","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ant colony optimization; heuristic algorithm; airship; observation scheduling; task clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this problem, a particular set of customers has to be served before the rest of the customers using vehicles with different capacities. The problem is inspired by the current situation faced by a specialized gas distribution company in the northeast region of Mexico. The company produces and distributes three main products, although this paper focuses only on the oxygen distribution problem. The company delivers oxygen to industrial customers, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities. Due to Mexican government regulations, the company requires prioritizing deliveries to hospitals and medical facilities over its industrial customers. Therefore, the company is obliged to satisfy the customers demand considering inventory levels and priority constraints while minimizing the inventory and routing cost. An integer programming model is proposed to solve the problem. The model minimizes the total distribution cost while considering inventory level, priority constraints, and a fixed fleet of vehicles with different capacities. Finally, computational experiments were carried out using benchmark instances to validate the correctness of the proposed model and to analyze the effect of priorities on the total distribution cost. Finally, actual customers of the company were selected to show the effectiveness of the proposed model to solve real-world problems.","2020","2024-04-22 19:43:28","2024-04-22 19:43:28","","","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; inventory routing problem; priority deliveries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem investigated in this study is an extension of the basic problems, and it simultaneously optimizes production, replenishment, inventory, and routing decisions for perishable products that will deteriorate over the planning horizon. Additionally, the lead time has been considered in the replenishment echelon, and the unit inventory cost varying with the inventory time is considered in the inventory management. Based on a newly designed model, different inventory strategies are discussed in this study: old first (OF) and fresh first (FF) strategies both for the first echelon and second echelon, for which four propositions to model them are proposed. Then, four valid inequalities, including logical inequalities, a ( ℓ , S , W W ) inequality, and a replenishment-related inequality, are proposed to construct a branch-and-cut algorithm. The computational experiments are conducted to test the efficiency of valid inequalities, branch-and-cut, and policies. Experimental results show that the valid inequalities can effectively increase the relaxed lower bound by 4.80% on average and the branch-and-cut algorithm can significantly reduce the computational time by 58.18% on average when compared to CPLEX in small and medium-sized cases.

The problem with these services lies in the difficulty of the use of ICT by aged people due to digital divide and, at the same time, the high cost in human resources, time, vehicles, and fuel presented by delivery services in these areas. This work presents a system that combines the use of intelligent personal assistants (IPA) to facilitate access to information technology for aged people to place orders and the optimization of delivery routes in a rural environment by a socially-oriented logistics company. This work presents a case study based on the fixed delivery routes of a social logistics company and describes how the proposed system could help in the optimization of routes and the reception of orders by the elderly via ICTs thanks to the use of IPAs.

In this study, we investigate the design of flexible vehicle scheduling systems in order for a community organisation to serve more people and achieve higher operational efficiency.

Further, we identify an integrated service option and process flow for dial-a-ride passengers to ride on a vehicle with schedule route passengers. Because this option involves a complex decision, we formulate the problem as a two-stage decision model. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed design, we perform numerical simulations and conduct a case study by collaborating with a transportation organisation. We found that the proposed system would enable the organisation to serve more people with fewer vehicles but without an increase in the travelling time. These results demonstrate the importance of a flexible vehicle scheduling system for accessible transportation organisations to sustain their service operations.","2020","2024-04-22 19:43:29","2024-04-22 19:43:29","","","","14","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing problem; dial-a-ride; paratransit services; schedule route; system design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In view of the selection of temporary storage stations and realistic transportation demand, an efficiency-of-transport model of medical waste between hospitals and temporary storage stations is established by using an ant colony–tabu hybrid algorithm. In order to specify such status, Wuhan city in Hubei Province, China—considered the first city to suffer from COVID-19—was chosen as an example of verification; the two-level model and the immune algorithm–ant colony optimization–tabu search (IA–ACO–TS) algorithm were used for simulation and testing, which achieved good verification.

Task assignment and path planning for multiple UAVs in the above scenarios are essential for successful mission execution. But, effectively balancing tasks to better excavate the potential of UAVs remains a challenge, as well as efficiently generating feasible solutions from the current one in constrained explosive solution spaces with the increase in the scale of optimization problems. This paper proposes an efficient approach for task assignment and path planning with the objective of balancing the tasks among UAVs and achieving satisfactory temporal resolutions. To be specific, we add virtual nodes according to the number of UAVs to the original model of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), thus make it easier to form a solution suitable for heuristic algorithms. Besides, the concept of the universal distance matrix is proposed to transform the temporal constraints to spatial constraints and simplify the programming model. Then, a Swap-and-Judge Simulated Annealing (SJSA) algorithm is therefore proposed to improve the efficiency of generating feasible neighboring solutions. Extensive experimental and comparative studies on different scenarios demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with the exact algorithm and meta-heuristic algorithms. The results also inspire us about the characteristics of a population-based algorithm in solving combinatorial discrete optimization problems.","2020","2024-04-22 19:43:30","2024-04-22 19:43:30","","","","17","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","simulated annealing; path planning; heuristic algorithm; unmanned aerial vehicle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The requests of the former arrive dynamically while the latter are known a priori. In this study, we focus on the case of limited fleet, which fulfills all delivery orders, but may not have enough capacity to serve all pick up orders within the available working horizon. The problem’s dynamic nature and the attention to customer service raise interesting considerations, especially related to the problem’s objectives. The problem is solved through periodic re-optimization, acknowledging the fact that this pseudo-dynamic approach may lead to some limitations. For the underlying (static) optimization problem we propose appropriate objective functions, which account for vehicle productivity and propose a branch-and-price (BP) approach to solve it to optimality. The results indicate how the performance of the various objectives is impacted by different re-optimization frequencies and policies in this practically relevant environment of dynamic demand served by a limited fleet. Specifically, extensive experimentation indicates that accounting for vehicle productivity within a typical periodic re-optimization solution framework may result to higher customer service under a range of operational settings, in comparison to conventional objectives.","2020","2024-04-22 19:43:30","2024-04-22 19:43:30","","","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","dynamic pickup-and-delivery; dynamic vehicle routing; limited fleet in vehicle routing; re-optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two-echelon distribution systems are attractive from an economic standpoint, whereas the product from the depot can be distributed from or to intermediate facilities. In this case, the intermediate facilities are considered as locker facilities present in an accessible location in the vicinity of the final customers. In addition, the utilization of locker facilities can reduce the cost caused by the unattended deliveries. The problem is addressed as an optimization model that formulated into an integer linear programming model denoted as the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with locker facilities (2EVRP-LF). The objective is to minimize the cost of transportation with regards to the vehicle travelling cost, the intermediate facilities renting cost, and the additional cost to compensate the customer that needs to travel to access the intermediate facilities. Because of its complexity, a simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. On the other hand, the modelling approach can be conducted by generating two-phase optimization model approaches, which are the p-median problem and the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The results from both methods are compared in numerical experiments. The results show the effectiveness of 2EVRP-LF compared to the two-phase optimization.

Reasonable task assignment, task scheduling, and UAV trajectory planning are the prerequisites for efficient cooperation of multi-functional heterogeneous UAVs. In this paper, a multi-swarm fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) with dual strategy switching is proposed to solve the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem with the criterion of simultaneously minimizing the makespan and the total mission time. First, the multi-swarm mechanism is introduced to enhance the global search capability of the fruit fly optimization algorithm. Second, in the smell-based search phase, the local search strategies and large-scale search strategies are designed to drive multiple fruit fly swarms, and the dual strategy switching method is presented. Third, in the vision-based search stage, the greedy selection strategy is adopted. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are designed.

The hybrid approach combines simulation, metaheuristics, and fuzzy logic, offering a feasible methodology to solve large-scale NP-hard problems under general uncertainty scenarios. These scenarios are commonly encountered in L&T optimization challenges, such as the vehicle routing problem or the team orienteering problem, among many others. The proposed methodology allows for modeling various problem components—including travel times, service times, customers’ demands, or the duration of electric batteries—as deterministic, stochastic, or fuzzy items.

In recent years, consumers have started to curb their habit of eating out from fast-food chain restaurants due to the growing concerns for unhealthy menu choices made primarily from highly processed and/or frozen food ingredients. To address these issues, some organizations in the fast-food industry have started to offer menus with fresh unfrozen ingredients sourced locally or regionally. This paper addresses the problem of integrating sourcing, storage, and distribution strategies for a fast-food restaurant chain at the regional level. We present an adaptive sequential optimization decision-making approach for procurement, storage, and distribution of perishable food products to multi-unit restaurants at the regional level. This solution approach uses shelf-life considerations in developing a procurement and distribution strategy for fresh produce in the era of hyperconnected logistics. Three models are developed using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). First, a procurement model is developed to find the cost-effective supplier for each produce category based on shelf life. Then, a distribution model is developed to find the cost-optimal solution for distributing produce to multiple restaurant locations considering weight, volume, and operation hours. Finally, an integrated model is developed to optimally combine procurement and distribution options generated by the first two models to minimize costs while respecting total shelf-life constraints. Numerical experiments based on realistic data are carried out to show that the proposed sequential approach yields valid decisions and presents the effects of price, shelf-life, and demand changes on the supply chain.","2024","2024-04-22 19:43:53","2024-04-22 19:43:53","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mixed integer linear programming; fast-food procurement; fresh produce distribution; hyperconnected logistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focuses on the Tula River region in Hidalgo, Mexico, exploring the evacuation and support of individuals in temporary shelters. Despite the fact that the topic has been addressed in the literature, it is necessary to have quick response methods that can be used by decision-makers to adapt and utilize existing spaces as temporary shelters, in addition to knowing how to evacuate people. Methods: Addressing this void, a methodology to minimize evacuation and aid distribution costs is introduced. Leveraging existing algorithms, particularly Integer Linear Programming, the model determines shelter activation and utilizes the Vehicle Routing Problem to assess aid delivery strategies. Results: The research identifies optimal evacuation routes from 13 affected areas to 34 shelters and analyzes aid distribution costs under various demand scenarios: original, increased, and decreased by 10%, based on the number of transport units allocated and Google Maps distances. It also evaluates the costs associated with humanitarian aid distribution under varying collection strategies, involving state and municipal governments.

This process demands high levels of safety and timeliness. The rapid advancement of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain offers a viable solution to this challenge. To this end, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Infection Sample Collection system (BISC) consisting of a two-echelon drone-assisted mechanism. The system utilizes collector drones to gather samples from user points and transport them to designated transit points, while deliverer drones convey the packaged samples from transit points to testing centers. We formulate the described problem as a Two-Echelon Heterogeneous Drone Routing Problem with Transit point Synchronization (2E-HDRP-TS). To obtain near-optimal solutions to 2E-HDRP-TS, we introduce a multi-objective Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for Drone Routing (ALNS-RD). The algorithm’s multi-objective functions are designed to minimize the total collection time of infection samples and the exposure index. In addition to traditional search operators, ALNS-RD incorporates two new search operators based on flight distance and exposure index to enhance solution efficiency and safety. Through a comparison with benchmark algorithms such as NSGA-II and MOLNS, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ALNS-RD algorithm are validated, demonstrating its superior performance across all five instances with diverse complexity levels.","2024","2024-04-22 19:43:53","2024-04-22 19:43:53","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","routing; adaptive large neighborhood search; synchronization; blockchain; drone-assisted sample collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evacuation planning plays an important role in emergency logistics management, particularly when it comes to addressing transit-dependent populations that are often neglected in previous studies. This systematic literature review explores the current state of transit-based evacuation planning and examines the current gaps. We focused on transit-based evacuation planning problems that used optimisation and modelling approaches. This review conducts an extensive analysis of relevant studies to provide a comprehensive overview, identify research gaps, and outline future directions in the evacuation planning body of knowledge. Using an integrated systematic review methodology, a thorough search of the Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted, resulting in a total of 538 articles. These articles were screened and evaluated based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately yielding 82 studies for final analysis. The findings highlight the growing importance of optimisation and modelling approaches within transit-based evacuation planning. Studies emphasize the integration of public transportation networks into evacuation strategies to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and ensure evacuee safety. Transit-based evacuation planning is vital for both those without personal vehicles, making evacuation more equitable, and vehicle owners, particularly in earthquakes where vehicles might be inaccessible or trapped, demonstrating its wide usefulness in all emergency scenarios. Various optimisation and modelling approaches have been employed in transit-based evacuation planning studies to simulate and analyse the flow of evacuees and vehicles during emergencies. Transit-based evacuation planning exhibits unique characteristics within disaster management, including the consideration of spatial and temporal dynamics of transit systems, integration of social and demographic factors, and involvement of multiple stakeholders. Spatial and temporal dynamics encompass transportation schedules, capacities, and routes, while social and demographic factors involve variables such as income, age, and mobility status. Stakeholder engagement facilitates collaborative decision-making and effective plan development. However, transit-based evacuation planning faces challenges that require further research and development. Data availability and accuracy, model validation, stakeholder coordination, and the integration of uncertainty and dynamic factors pose significant hurdles. Addressing these challenges necessitates advances in data collection, robust modelling frameworks, and improved communication and coordination mechanisms among stakeholders. Addressing these gaps requires interdisciplinary collaborations and advances in data analytics and modelling techniques.","2024","2024-04-22 19:43:53","2024-04-22 19:43:53","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","optimisation; disaster; humanitarian operation management; modelling; transit-based evacuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The VRPSDP with fuzzy payloads poses a computationally intractable challenge, as it involves a fleet of vehicles departing from a central depot to both deliver and collect goods from a dispersed group of customers. To effectively tackle this problem, a genetic algorithm is applied that incorporates the concept of fuzziness. This problem diverges from the traditional VRPSDP by explicitly considering fuel consumption reduction towards environmental sustainability.

The studied Multi-Depot Periodic Petrol Station Replenishment problem derives from a real case in which the company must replenish a set of petrol stations from a set of depots, during a weekly planning horizon. The company must ensure refuelling according to available visiting patterns, which can be different from customer to customer. A visiting pattern predefines how many times (days) the replenishment occurs during a week and in which visiting days a certain amount of fuel must be delivered. To fulfill the weekly demand of each petrol station, one of the available replenishment plans must be selected among a given set of visiting patterns. The aim is to minimize the total distance travelled by the fleet of tank trucks during the entire planning horizon. A matheuristic approach is proposed, based on the cluster-first route-second paradigm, to solve it. The proposed approach is thoroughly tested on a set of realistic random instances.

However, in recent years, there has been a crowding problem in the charging stations resulting in queuing and unnecessary delays. In this study, we explore the potential of replacing single-port charging stations with multi-port charging stations that can serve multiple vehicles at once with a reduced charging rate.

Within this context, a fleet of autonomous vehicles can be modeled as a Dial-a-Ride Problem with certain features. In this study, we propose a holistic solving approach to this problem, which combines the mixed-integer linear programming formulation with a novel graph dimension reduction method based on the graph embedding framework. This latter method is effective since accounting for heterogeneous travel demands of the covered territory tends to increase the size of the routing graph drastically, thus rendering the exact solving of small instances computationally infeasible. An application is provided for the real transport demand of the industrial district of “Vallée de la Chimie” in Lyon city, France. Instances involving more than 50 transport requests and 10 vehicles could be easily solved. Results suggest that this method generates routes of reduced nodes with lower vehicle kilometers traveled compared to the constrained K-means-based reduction. Reductions in terms of GHG emissions are estimated to be around 75% less than the private vehicle mode in our applied service. A sensitivity analysis is also provided.","2024","2024-04-22 19:43:53","2024-04-22 19:43:53","","","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vehicle routing; first–last-mile service; node embeddings; shared autonomous mobility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
