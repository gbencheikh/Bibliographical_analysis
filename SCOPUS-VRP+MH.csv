To provide timely and comprehensive service to these customers, a re-optimization framework utilizing an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) has been developed. In our ALNS algorithm, two novel removal operators and a time window compatibility-based insertion method are proposed to improve its accuracy and efficiency. This study demonstrates that our ALNS is well-suited for dynamic problems that require re-optimization within a very short period compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. While conducting benefit analyses for MD-DVRPTW, we illustrate that the fixed cost of the vehicle can also impact route planning. Furthermore, accelerating responsiveness does not necessarily improve dynamic problems; instead, it may increase costs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Dynamic VRP; Multi-depot VRP"

It is a known NP-hard problem and has significant practical applications in a variety of areas, such as logistics, planning, and scheduling. Route optimisation not only improves the overall profitability of a logistic centre but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by minimising the distance travelled. In this article, we propose a simple and improved heuristic algorithm named 2-Opt++, which solves symmetric TSP problems using an enhanced 2-Opt local search technique, to generate better results. As with 2-Opt, our proposed method can also be applied to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), with minor modifications. We have compared our technique with six existing algorithms, namely ruin and recreate, nearest neighbour, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, Tabu search, and ant colony optimisation. Furthermore, to allow for the complexity of larger TSP instances, we have used a graph compression/candidate list technique that helps in reducing the computational complexity and time. The comprehensive empirical evaluation carried out for this research work shows the efficacy of the 2-Opt++ algorithm as it outperforms the other well-known algorithms in terms of the error margin, execution time, and time of convergence. © 2023 by the authors.","combinatorial optimisation; heuristic algorithms; route optimisation; travelling salesman problem; TSPLIB; VRP"

To ensure the safe management of HCW, this article proposes a new model for HCW transportation that separates hazardous from non-hazardous waste along the transportation route. The proposed model is based on the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem, where each type of waste is carried in a dedicated compartment, and the objective is to minimize the total route cost. Considering the NP-hardness of the problem, an adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed based on the results of statistical pre-post testing of the population.

Efficient battery replacement is critical to maintain the operational capability of e-bicycles, but is quite difficult as there are often a large number of e-bicycles that are widely dispersed. In this paper, we study a problem of scheduling multiple vehicles to deliver fully-charged batteries to and take back low-power batteries from shared e-bicycles scattered in numerous parking spots, while the low-power batteries are recharged in battery depots for potential re-utilization. The aim of this problem is to minimize the completion time of all battery replacement tasks so as to keep a high operational efficiency of the system. The problem differs from existing vehicle routing problems in two main special features: (1) equivalent exchange of fully-charged batteries and low-power batteries; (2) recycling of batteries. To efficiently solve this special problem, we propose an evolutionary algorithm using variable local-search-based mutation to balance global exploration and local exploitation and employing enhanced local search around each newly found best known solution to improve accuracy.

It offers promising solutions to numerous challenges in traditional transportation systems, among which the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a significant concern addressed in this work. Considering the varying urgency levels of different vehicles and their different traveling constraints in the Service-oriented Cooperative ITS (SoC-ITS) framework studied in our previous research, the Service-oriented Cooperative Vehicle Routing Problem (SoC-VRP) is firstly analyzed, in which cooperative planning and vehicle urgency degrees are two vital factors. After examining the characteristics of both VRP and SoC-VRP, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based prioritized route planning mechanism is proposed. Specifically, we establish a deep reinforcement learning model with Rainbow DQN and devise a prioritized successive decision-making route planning method for SoC-ITS, where vehicle urgency degrees are mapped to three priorities: High for emergency vehicles, Medium for shuttle buses, and Low for the rest. All proposed models and methods are implemented, trained using various scenarios on typical road networks, and verified with SUMO-based scenes.

Generally, in the VRP each customer is served in one fixed service location. However, in the VRPTW-FL each customer is served in one of a set of potential service locations, each of which has a certain capacity. From a practical point of view, the VRPTW-FL is highly relevant due to its numerous applications, e.g. parcel delivery, routing with limited parking space, and hospital-wide scheduling of physical therapists. Theoretically, the VRPTW-FL is challenging to solve due to the limited location capacities. When serving a customer, location availability must be ensured at every time. To solve this problem, we present a mathematical model and a tailored hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search. Our heuristic makes use of an innovative backtracking approach during the construction phase to alter unsatisfactory decisions at an early stage.

This surge calls for novel strategies to optimize vehicle utilization while maintaining timely delivery. In response, many online retailers are incentivizing customers to embrace delayed home deliveries by offering economic incentives. Nonetheless, current transportation systems fall short in accommodating orders with extended delivery windows, primarily adhering to the First-In-First-Out rule and distance minimization via the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). In this paper, we introduce a new consolidation-based delivery methodology that addresses these challenges. Our approach accounts for orders with daily-based time windows and also anticipates future demand realizations (i.e., expected incoming orders). We characterize this consolidation problem using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and propose a custom metaheuristic approach that can tackle the problem on a large-scale setting, introducing a significant novelty approach in last-mile delivery research. We applied our methodology to one of Mexico's largest retailers and compared its performance against the company's existing transportation systems. O approach substantially improves vehicle utilization and yields considerable reductions in distance traveled, time, and overall transportation costs, achieving cost savings of up to 52%. These savings represent tangible benefits, enabling potential revenue enhancements for businesses and cost-effective, timely deliveries for consumers. Additionally, the increased vehicle utilization implies fewer vehicles are needed for the same volume of deliveries, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. This innovative approach, therefore, presents a practical and highly effective solution for managing large-scale last-mile delivery scenarios. © 2023 The Author","Consolidation; E-commerce; Fast-shipping; Large-scale optimization; Last-mile delivery"

From the perspective of carbon neutrality, this paper studies two types of vehicle routing problems (VRP) regarding third-party logistics: One is the carbon-neutral vehicle routing problem (CNVRP), and the other is the multi-stage carbon-neutral vehicle routing problem (MSCNVRP). In this paper, we consider three objective functions for the CNVRP and MSCNVRP models respectively: total cost minimization, fleet size minimization, and carbon emission minimization. We first linearize the constructed nonlinear CNVRP and MSCNVRP models, and then verify the validity and reliability of the models through numerical examples. Numerical experimental results show that considering the total cost minimization objective leads to a better solution for fleet size and routing in transportation. In addition, in terms of the uncertainty of carbon sink price, the MSCNVRP model has more advantages than the CNVRP model. Changes in carbon sink prices and the availability of funds to achieve carbon neutrality have no effect on fleet size and vehicle routing for models whose objective functions are to minimize total costs, but models with the objective functions of minimizing fleet size or carbon emissions are more sensitive. The results also showed that companies with multiple types of vehicles have an advantage in transportation costs. In particular, the models proposed herein can provide flexible solutions for companies in third-party logistics to achieve carbon-neutral transportation. © 2023 The Author(s)","Carbon neutrality; Global climate change; Third-party logistics; Vehicle routing problem; Waste transport"

Traditional methods for solving the Location Routing Problem (LRP) often focus on the fixed constraints and ignore the variable vehicle characteristics, dynamic operations, different modes or underlying infrastructure. This paper proposes an integrated approach for modular and intuitive metaheuristic for LRP. The route planning phase is incorporated by means of agent-based transport simulation, which provides additional flexibility with respect to the vehicle fleet, demand characteristics, or the use of external problem constraints. Therefore, this approach can be easily applied to practical problems and used to optimise transport networks in a flexible and modular manner. Moreover, the algorithm developed here can independently converge to the near-optimal number and location of logistics sites. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and the performance of our approach by performing several simulation experiments in the context of a sensitivity analysis and comparing the results with well-known benchmark solutions.

In recent years, there has been widespread utilization of helicopters for postdisaster rescue. However, efficiently dispatching helicopters to reach rescue sites in post-disaster rescue is a challenge. To address this issue, this study models the issue of dispatching helicopters as a specific variant of the VRP with time window (VRPTW). Considering that the VRPTW is an NP-hard problem, the genetic algorithm (GA) as one of the prominent evolutionary algorithms with robust optimization capabilities, is a good candidate to deal with this issue. In this study, an improved GA with a local search strategy and global search strategy is proposed. To begin, a cooperative initialization strategy is proposed to generate an initial population with high quality and diversity. Subsequently, a local search strategy is presented to improve the exploitation ability. Additionally, a global search strategy is embedded to enhance the global search performance. Finally, 56 instances extended from Solomon instances are utilized for conducting simulation tests. The simulation results indicate that the average relative percentage increase (RPI) of the distance travelled by helicopters as obtained by the proposed algorithm is 0.178, 0.027, 0.075 and 0.041 times smaller than the average RPIs obtained by the tabu search algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm, hybrid GA and simulated annealing algorithm, respectively.

By improving the vehicle routing process, package delivery speed could be increased, and especially for medical emergency-related items, this will drastically impact the nature of delivery, cost, and time spent on it. This is being done to prepare an efficient routing model for the vehicle route, which will ultimately result in an improved path. As they have a variety of restrictions, the goal of this article is to identify the various parameters that, when used with a multi-objective optimization-based routing model, will satisfy the limit. The routing route may be made more efficient using ant colony optimization (ACO) in conjunction with an upgraded recurrent model of the genetic algorithm (GA). To achieve this, the ACO-GA optimization method known as metaheuristic link prediction (MLP) was used for parameter prediction. This method offers an evaluation of the relationship between the emission of CO2 (carbon dioxide), the trip region, and the other associated parameters. The authors of this study compare the findings of their prior work, which combined ACO and K-means clustering to get better results. Once the results are established, they will become the primary objective function of the optimization algorithm, which will be responsible for choosing the path that is connected to the parameter values.

Consequently, a bi-objective overlapped links vehicle routing problem (OLVRP) for valuable goods transportation is developed in this study, where the total cost and risk of routing are minimized. Moreover, a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed to optimize the problem, and its efficiency and effectiveness for small-to-medium and large-scale problems are evaluated. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior and highly efficient compared to The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Finally, the proposed model is used to conduct a real-world case study on cash distribution in Tehran province, Iran, one of the most widely used types of valuable goods transportation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cash-in-transit; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Overlapped link; Risk; Valuable goods; Vehicle routing problem"

Low-capacity vehicles are utilized to perform collection only in the inner part of the city because of restricted access and limited infrastructure to be expanded. While, high-capacity vehicles are used to transform waste from the border of the inner city to the recycling centers located outside of city. Vehicles of the first and second echelons visit each other at meeting points, which do not have storage capacity mainly because of environmental and social consequences of the transshipment of waste. The timing aspect plays a critical role at meeting points to ensure the reasonable sequence of operations. So, temporal synchronization, a critical aspect of 2E-VRP, is considered in this paper, as well as minimization of waiting time of vehicles in meeting points to avoid long dwelling time. Moreover, because the previous study of 2E-VRP has not dealt with space limitation of meeting points, this paper presents a 2E-VRP that incorporates temporal synchronization, waiting time, and temporal capacity simultaneously for the first time to address a more practical model. To solve the mentioned problem a set of capable and latest metaheuristics are proposed as well as the hybrid ones to probe their efficiency and reasonably construct high quality routes. Moreover, the impact of the temporal capacity is investigated compared to temporal synchronization without considering temporal capacity. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Meta-heuristic Algorithms; Temporal Capacity; Temporal synchronization; Two-echelon vehicle routing problem"

Over the last decades, many variants of LS using different neighborhood operators, exploration strategies, and speedup techniques have been developed. These design choices can critically influence the performance of an LS in terms of both solution quality and computational effort. Despite the importance of LS in metaheuristics for VRPs, systematic investigations on the impact and importance of different design decisions in LS are nonexistent even for basic VRP variants, and clear recommendations on meaningful combinations of these decisions are not available. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of design decisions in a granular LS for the capacitated VRP (CVRP). To this end, we compare the performance of a large number of algorithmic variants of the granular LS on two CVRP benchmark sets. We use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine non-dominated algorithmic variants, and we use performance profiles to visualize the results with regard to solution quality and runtime. In this way, we are able to identify good combinations of decisions and give final design recommendations on granular LS.

This article deals with the mathematical formulation of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (MDVRP-D), whereby a set of heterogeneous trucks, each paired with a UAV, are located in different depots. Both types of vehicles deliver goods to customers; UAVs are dispatched from trucks while en route to make the last-mile delivery. A metaheuristic algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) principle is proposed as the solution. This algorithm has been adapted for this newly proposed problem; the novel mechanics include the probabilistic decision to dispatch an UAV, the selection of a customer to be served, and local search optimization. Extensive computational experiments are performed to verify the proposed algorithm. First, its performance is compared with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristics on a set of Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRP-D) benchmarks. A set of various benchmark instances are subsequently proposed for the newly formulated MDVRP-D (differing in complexity and graph topology). Finally, the behavior of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly analyzed, especially in respect of features connected with UAVs.

Thus, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) has become a very important problem because of its practicality in real-world applications. In addition, most customers prefer to have their goods delivered in a specific time interval, and sustainability has become a very important issue for most companies. Therefore, this study proposes a mathematical model for a multi-objective VRP with time windows (VRPTW) as well as an algorithm to solve it. The model consists of two objectives: minimizing the total supply chain cost, and carbon emission. Besides the objectives, the proposed model and algorithm also consider the disruption that commonly happens in the supply chain. This study designs a two-stage VRPTW to solve the disruption. The first stage is the supply chain in ideal condition, while the second one is the supply chain in disrupted condition since the increase in the supply chain complexity also leads to more vulnerability to disruptions. This study improves a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) to solve the problem. As fitness cannot decide which algorithm is better, this study uses quality indicators to compare all of the algorithms. Based on the computational result, the improved MOPSO has the highest hypervolume and lowest spacing. Thus, it can be concluded that the improved MOPSO is the best algorithm to solve disruption in the two-stage VRPTW. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Green supply chain; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm; Supply chain disruption; Vehicle routing problem with time windows"

The capacity-utilised vehicle routing problem (CVRP) stands as a notable variant, necessitating a nuanced interplay between the exploration and exploitation phases due to its discrete nature. While the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) enjoys recognition in the optimisation domain for its streamlined design and efficacy, its foundational architecture is inherently suited for continuous optimisation tasks. Addressing this gap, our paper presents a refined iteration of SSA, termed mSSA. By ingeniously integrating the core principles of SSA with the opposition-based learning (OBL) approach and incorporating the roulette wheel selection (RWS) mechanism, mSSA is meticulously crafted to navigate the discrete challenges posed by expansive CVRP instances. To affirm the robustness of mSSA, our research undertook performance evaluations in three distinct CVRPs: initially, an 8-customer assignment to validate stability, followed by two practical tests involving the distribution of cement to 30 and 50 customers in Vietnam. Empirical findings consistently highlight mSSA's dominant performance against other meta-heuristic techniques tailored for CVRP. This positions mSSA as a formidable tool in decision-making processes, particularly for optimising cement delivery using limited-capacity vehicles. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision support system; discrete optimisation; management; salp swarm algorithm; transportation; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

This study proposes a model for optimizing efficiency in supply chain networks through inbound and outbound Collaborative Logistics implementation among the carriers in centralized, coordinated networks with cross-docking.

Unlike the previous studies that have considered Collaborative Logistics from the cost and profit-sharing perspective, the proposed model seeks to determine an appropriate form of Collaborative Logistics in the VRP. Findings: This article shows that in a three-echelon supply chain consisting of a set of suppliers, a set of customers and a cross-docking terminal, partial collaboration among the inbound carriers and outbound carriers outperforms no/complete collaboration.

A visiting pattern predefines how many times (days) the replenishment occurs during a week and in which visiting days a certain amount of fuel must be delivered. To fulfill the weekly demand of each petrol station, one of the available replenishment plans must be selected among a given set of visiting patterns. The aim is to minimize the total distance travelled by the fleet of tank trucks during the entire planning horizon.

In developing countries, this becomes even more challenging due to limited vehicles, road conditions, and inadequate cold storage. Since it is impractical to construct permanent warehouses when pandemics occur, vaccine distribution would be extravagant both environmentally and financially. In this study, a new multi-objective MILP model combining two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP) and vaccine supply chain (VSC) is presented to minimize the number of unsatisfied doses undelivered to customers.

The model is solved using the commercial solver CPLEX for different datasets. Then the heuristic is used to solve the same datasets, and the results are compared based on the solution's quality and computation efforts.

For the biomass waste collection, there is a recognized need for novel models to locate the collection facilities and plan the vehicle routes. So far most location-routing models fall into the cost-driven-only category. However, comprehensive objectives are required in the specific context, such as time-dependent pollution and speed- and load-related emission. Furthermore, LRPs are hierarchical by nature, containing the facility location problems (strategic level) and the vehicle routing problems (VRPs) (tactical level). Existing studies in this field usually adopt computational intelligence methods directly without decomposing the problem. This can be inefficient especially when multiple objectives are applied. Motivated by these, we develop a novel multiobjective optimization model for the LRP for biomass waste collection. To solve this model, we explore the way to tailor evolutionary algorithms to the hierarchical structure. We develop adapted versions of two commonly used evolutionary algorithms: 1) the genetic algorithm and 2) the ant colony optimization algorithm. For the genetic algorithm, we divide the population by the strategic level decisions, so that each subpopulation has a fixed location plan, breaking the LRP down into many multidepot VRPs. For the ant colony optimization, we use an additional pheromone vector to track the good decisions on the location level, and segregate the pheromones related to different satellite depots to avoid misleading information. Thus, the problem degenerates into VRP. Experimental results show that our proposed methods have better performances on the LRP for biomass waste collection. © 2023 IEEE.","Ant colony optimization; genetic algorithm; location-routing; multiobjective optimization; multipopulation technique"

Conventional approaches to tackling VRP have primarily focused on optimizing each task independently, utilizing mathematical methodologies or evolutionary algorithms. Nevertheless, research exploring the application of the advanced concept of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) to address VRP remains limited. To enrich the body of knowledge in this field, our study presents an innovative EMT algorithm, dubbed EMT-RD. This algorithm employs a bidirectional adaptive codec to facilitate the transfer of information between real and discrete solutions. The EMT-RD algorithm permits the transfer of real and discrete solutions across varying tasks, utilizing an encoding rule that transforms information from real to discrete solutions for each task. Further, a decoding rule from discrete to real solutions generates search experiences, facilitating the transfer of knowledge between real solutions. The mechanism is capped off with an adaptive transfer strategy that instigates transfer operations across different tasks. Each task is tackled using a single-task optimization algorithm that employs an artificial bee colony algorithm. Through comprehensive experimentation, we found that our proposed EMT-RD algorithm outperforms competitors on 168 VRP with time windows multitasking instance pairs and four real-world problem pairs that were developed for this study.

It is a real-world problem originating from the policies of a Nordic distribution company. The problem includes a single depot, a non-predetermined hierarchy of intermediate facilities, and two different fleets, consisting of homogeneous original and homogeneous local vehicles, which are pulling swap-bodies. Original vehicles with attached swap-bodies depart from the central depot. They can either visit customers directly if only one swap-body is attached or visit one or two consecutive switch points in order to transfer one or two loaded swap-bodies to a corresponding number of local vehicles, which are subsequently routed to customers while the original vehicle itself proceeds to serve customers with the remaining loaded swap-body.

We refer to this problem as the Autonomous Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (ADVRP) and present its mixed-integer linear programming formulation.

To evaluate our proposed solution methodology, we conduct computational experiments on various related Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) from the literature and newly generated ADVRP instances.

A common trait of these applications is usually the large scale size of problem instances, which require fast algorithms to generate solutions of acceptable quality. The basis for many VRP approaches is a heuristic which builds a candidate solution that may subsequently be improved by a local search procedure. Since there are many variants of the basic VRP model, specialised algorithms must be devised that take into account specific constraints and user-defined objective measures. Another factor is that the scheduling process may be carried out in dynamic conditions, where future information may be uncertain or unavailable or may be subject to change. When all of this is considered, there is a need for customised heuristics, devised for a specific problem variant, that could be used in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we use genetic programming (GP) to evolve a suitable dispatching rule to build solutions for different objectives and classes of VRP problems, applicable in both dynamic and stochastic conditions.

We formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and develop an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for this problem. To show the advantage of mobile production, we compare the problem with the Central Production Vehicle Routing Problem (CP-VRP), where production takes place in a central depot. We also propose an efficient ALNS for the CP-VRP.

We test different scenarios with varying numbers of machines in each vehicle, as well as different production time.

To address this, we introduce a multitask-based evolutionary algorithm (MBEA), which assists the optimization of the original large-scale problem by constructing multiple simple and similar subtasks and utilizing transfer learning to accelerate convergence speed. First, a subset of orders is randomly selected from the original problem to construct various subtasks, and then a multitask evolutionary approach is applied to generate candidate solutions for the original problem and subtasks. Given that the subtasks are simpler yet similar to the original problem, useful routing traits can be shared through knowledge transfer among the tasks, thereby speeding up its evolutionary search.

Findings: The solutions generated by both algorithms were subjected to the t-test, and the results revealed that the GA outperformed in solution quality in planning a heterogeneous fleet for distribution with load balancing. Through a number of scenarios, the baseline conditions of the problem were further tested investigating the alternative fleet utilization with different compositions of the heterogeneous fleet. Results were analyzed using ANOVA and Hsu’s MCB method and found that removing the lowest capacities trucks enhances the average vehicle utilization with reduced travel distance. Research limitations/implications: The developed model has considered both planning of heterogeneous fleet and the requirement of work load balancing which are very common industry needs, however, have not been addressed adequately either individually or collectively in the literature. The adopted solution methodologies to solve the NP-hard distribution problem consist of metaheuristics, statistical analysis and scenario analysis are another significant contribution. The planning of distribution operations not only addresses operational-level decision, through a scenario analysis, but also strategic-level decision has also been considered.

In this paper, we introduce a fully automated system for drone-based last-mile delivery through incorporation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A novel problem called the autonomous vehicle routing problem with drones (A-VRPD) is defined. A-VRPD is to select AVs from a pool of available AVs based on crowd sourcing, assign selected AVs to customer groups, and schedule routes for selected AVs to optimize the total operational cost. We formulate A-VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and propose an optimization framework to solve the problem. A greedy algorithm is also developed to significantly improve the running time for large-scale delivery scenarios. Extensive simulations were conducted taking into account real-world operational costs for different types of AVs, traveled distances calculated considering the real-time traffic conditions using Google Map API, and varying load capacities of AVs. We evaluated the performance in comparison with two different state-of-the-art solutions: an algorithm designed to address the traditional vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D), which involves human-operated trucks working in tandem with drones to deliver parcels, and an algorithm for the two echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), wherein parcels are first transported to satellite locations and subsequently delivered from those satellites to the customers.

Therefore, this problem can be seen as a rich variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and named as a multi-depot VRP with time windows, split pickup and split delivery (MDVRP-TW-SP-SD). The problem is to determine the optimal number of vehicles from each depot to be hired and their optimal routes (sequence for visiting pickup and demand nodes) such that the total cost of hiring the vehicles, routing cost and penalty for unmet demand are minimized and it is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem.

In real environment, we can find situations involving a very large number of clients or constraints which indicate that exact methods should be avoided. In this context, this paper presents two metaheuristcs which are used to solve a complex problem named the Heterogeneous Site-Dependent Multi-depot Multi-trip Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (HSDMDMTPVRP). The HSDMDMTPVRP is a real problem found in the automotive industry and considers several well-known Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). The first metaheuristic is an adaptation of the Unified Hybrid Genetic Search (UHGS) which considers an advanced diversity control, feasibility control and a restart mechanism. The second one is a new metaheuristic named Adaptive Variable Neighborhood Race (AVNR) which combines variable neighborhood search and adaptive mechanisms integrated with a shrinking population managed with a diversity mechanism. Both approaches are also used for solving some variants of the VRP: Heterogeneous VRP, Site dependent VRP, Periodic VRP and Multi-trip VRP. Our computational experiments used 398 available instances in the literature with generic code path and also present 20 new instances for the HSDMDMTPVRP. The metaheuristics solved all instances with only one set of parameters and the results outperform or present the same solutions found by several state-of-the-art algorithms, showing the good performance of the approaches. Out of the 398 previously tested literature instances, the proposed metaheuristics found 140 new best-known solutions and 209 of the best-known ones.

We have implemented and compared optimization algorithms such as Intra-Route Local Search, Inter-Route Local Search, and Tabu Search that provide a suboptimal solution to the greedy solution of this NP-hard problem. We compared the solution provided by these algorithms with the optimal solution that can be obtained in exponential time using processing time and precision.

Due to the many stops of the trucks, this strategy causes high fuel consumption, emissions and noise. These effects can be alleviated by reducing the number of stops performed by the collection vehicles. One possibility consists of selecting a subset of candidate locations that are scattered throughout the municipality to place collection points which are used by residents to bring their waste. Provided that the underlying road network is available and that the collection vehicle has a known capacity, we refer to this problem as the capacitated multi-vehicle covering tour problem on a road network (Cm-CTP-R). We propose a road-network-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that exploits the sparsity of the network. We compare it against the MILP formulation that results from assuming a customer-based graph, which is typically used in vehicle routing problems (VRP). To solve large instances, we develop a two-phased heuristic approach that addresses the two subproblems the Cm-CTP-R is built on: a set covering problem to select the locations and a split-delivery VRP to determine the tours. Computational experiments on instances derived from real-life data show that the road-network-based formulation is better suited. Furthermore, the proposed heuristic provides good solutions with optimality gaps below 1.7% and finds better solutions for most of the instances that the exact method is not able to solve within a given time limit. © 2023 The Authors","Combinatorial optimization; Mixed-integer linear programming; Multi-vehicle covering tour problem; Road network; Waste collection"

Therefore, this study aims to support decision makers to plan routes for road freight transportation considering not only the logistics cost, but also travel safety due to road hazards. An analytical approach based on statistics was developed in which data of vehicle accidents and road features were used to estimate the risk cost by using the Monte Carlo simulation.

Researchers are becoming progressively concerned about the destruction it is producing to the environment, and EVs are identified to play a part in equalizing the balance. In the Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CE-VRP), the vehicles have a limited delivery capacity and rely completely on their limited battery capacity. Besides, all vehicle has a limited driving range and must recharge their battery at some customer’s locations.

The objective is to determine the optimal vehicle route in order to minimize the total distance satisfying the particular constraints and criteria.

This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem.

One of the most important variations within this problem is called Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP), in which environmental aspects are considered when designing product delivery routes. This variant arises due to the high levels of pollution produced by transport vehicles, so it is a variation whose study represents a vital impact nowadays. This project will consider a GVRP and will be developed considering the characteristics of multi-depot (MDVRP) and multi-product (MPVRP) to minimize the costs of assignation of vehicles and CO2 emissions. To solve the problem, this project proposes a hybridization between the classic tabu search (TS) metaheuristic and the PAES algorithm (TS+PAES) to generate the Pareto frontier of both objectives. An integer mixed linear programming model is formulated and developed for each objective function separately to have an optimal point of comparison for the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Also, the TS+PAES algorithm is compared to the nearest neighbor algorithm for large instances. Two computational experiments were carried out, one for small and the other one for large instances. The experiment for small instances showed that the GAP of each extreme of the frontier compared to the MILP model is on average 0.73%. For large instances, the metaheuristic improves in 0.1% the results presented by the MILP model showing that the metaheuristic provides closer near-optimal solutions in less computational time. Besides, the metaheuristic, in comparison with the nearest neighborhood heuristic, improves in 44.21% the results of emissions and in 3.88% the costs.

It is a typical extended vehicle routing problem (VRP) with both time and space constraints. We consider the VRPC problem characteristics and establish a vehicle scheduling model to minimize operating costs and maximize user (or passenger) experience. To solve the scheduling model more accurately, a spatiotemporal distance representation function is defined based on the temporal and spatial properties of the customer, and a spatiotemporal distance embedded hybrid ant colony algorithm (HACA-ST) is proposed. The algorithm can be divided into two stages. First, through spatiotemporal clustering, the spatiotemporal distance between users is the main measure used to classify customers in categories, which helps provide heuristic information for problem solving. Second, an improved ant colony algorithm (ACO) is proposed to optimize the solution by combining a labor division strategy and the spatiotemporal distance function to obtain the final scheduling route. Computational analysis is carried out based on existing data sets and simulated urban instances. Compared with other heuristic algorithms, HACA-ST reduces the length of the shortest route by 2%–14% in benchmark instances. In VRPC testing instances, concerning the combined cost, HACA-ST has competitive cost compared to existing VRP-related algorithms.

In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming is proposed for HFFOVRP. Because this problem, like VRP, is related to NP-hard issues, it is not possible to use exact methods to solve real-world problems. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on the ant colony algorithm called MACO is presented. This algorithm uses only global updating pheromones for a more efficient search of feasible space and considers a minimum value for pheromones on the edges. Also, pheromones of some best solutions obtained so far are updated, based on the quality of the solutions at each iteration, and three local search algorithms are used for the intensification mechanism.

The problem we consider combines the following attributes. Customers requesting services are variable, in the sense that they are stochastic, but are not restricted to a predefined set. Furthermore, demand volumes are also stochastic and are observed upon visiting customers. The objective is to maximize the expected served demands while meeting vehicle capacity and time restrictions. We call this problem the VRP with a highly Variable Customer basis and Stochastic Demands (VRP-VCSD). We first propose a classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for the VRP-VCSD. The resulting model is, however, unusable due to the explosion in the dimension of the state and action spaces. To solve the VRP-VCSD, we propose a number of methodological contributions aimed at reducing the state and action spaces. We first reformulate the MDP as an MDP with a consecutive action selection procedure. In this formulation, we enforce the treatment of a single vehicle (as opposed to multiple vehicles) at each decision epoch. We then introduce an observation function that selects a subset of the available information, which is deemed relevant for the considered vehicle in each epoch. We develop a Q-learning algorithm called QN-CO. In particular, we use a continuous state representation and incorporate a two-layer artificial neural network to approximate the Q values. Furthermore, we propose an aggregation strategy yielding a fixed-size output. Finally, we enhance our algorithm with Replay Memory and a Double Q Network. We conduct a thorough computational analysis. Results show that QN-CO considerably outperforms five benchmark policies.

Supply disruption may reduce the capacity of suppliers, and the transportation network disruption may decrease the number of vehicles in the fleet and disrupt some routes. Also, increasing environmental regulations and environmental awareness makes companies pay more attention to green supply chain management (GSCM). In this paper, we integrate green and resilient supplier selection and order allocation decisions with vehicle routing decisions under disruption. We present a multiproduct two-stage risk-averse mixed-integer stochastic linear programming for the green and resilient supplier selection and order allocation integrated with vehicle routing (G&RSS&OA-V) problem. We consider resilient strategies before disruption, including multiple sourcing, supplier fortification, prepositioned inventory at the protected supplier, and contract with third-party logistics providers (3PLs). The objective function is to minimize the total mean-risk cost and the cost of greenhouse emissions. We use conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a risk measure to control the risk of worst-case cost. The most significant decisions of this model are the strategic decisions of determining the optimal suppliers and the operational decisions of vehicles routing under disruption simultaneously. Other decisions include determining which suppliers should be fortified, the amount to be transported to the hybrid manufacturing-distribution (HMD) center through the supplier or prepositioned emergency inventory, and the amount of lost sales. In order to validate the proposed model and its features, several numerical examples along with sensitivity analysis are performed by GAMS software, which shows the efficiency and application of the developed model, and some managerial insights are reported. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that as α increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the mean-CVaR objective function cost increases to 13.2%. As λ increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the mean-CVaR objective function cost increases to 35.6%. The increase of these two risk factors makes the proposed model more risk-averse. As the expected shortage cost increases by 150%, the mean-CVaR objective function cost increases to 36% while the amount of expected shortage decreases by 56%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Disruption risk and resilience; Fuel consumption; Green paradigm and greenhouse emissions; Supplier selection/order allocation problem; Two-stage stochastic programming; Vehicle routing problem"

In other words, it combines the well-known vehicle routing problem (VRP) with the facility location problem (FLP). Hence, the LRP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which justifies the use of metaheuristic approaches whenever large-scale instances need to be solved. In this paper, we explore a realistic version of the LRP in which facilities of different capacities are considered, i.e., the manager has to consider not only the location but also the size of the facilities to open. In order to tackle this optimization problem, three mixed-integer linear formulations are proposed and compared. As expected, they have been proved to be cost- and time- inefficient.

The problem originates from the policies of a distribution company in the Nordic countries where HCVs of up to 34.5 m and up to 76 tons are allowed. The HMSME-VRP offer a new way to model distribution problems to cover large geographical areas without substantial costs in infrastructure. Furthermore, it adds complexity to the standard VRP and, as such, remains NP-hard and difficult to solve to optimality. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that only very small instances can be solved to optimality by a commercial solver.

In order to evaluate the proposed procedures, 48 benchmark instances of various sizes and characteristics are generated and made publicly available, comprising of clustered, random, and semi-clustered customers.

One particularly challenging distribution operation is the transportation of fresh-cut flowers. This process demands that a required quality be maintained at every stage, spanning from the flower growers, wholesalers, and retailers to the end customer. Failure to uphold the required level of freshness can lead to adverse outcomes such as decreased profits, customer attrition, and a tarnished reputation. To investigate this complex distribution process, fresh flower distribution was studied using data from a reputed floral company in Sri Lanka with the aim of finding the optimal set of routes for the distribution of fresh-cut flowers. Methods: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants were employed and the ‘Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Perishable Goods with Single Depot’ (CVRPTWfPGSD) was introduced. A hybrid method combining both heuristics and metaheuristics was selected as the methodology by considering several factors such as complexity, solution type, and execution time. The initial solution construction phase adopted the Path Cheapest Arc (PCA) heuristic. To further improve solution quality, the Guided Local Search (GLS) metaheuristic was applied. Results: This CVRPTWfPGSD model is validated for real-world scenarios, as it does not violate the maximum allowable perishability time provided for each vehicle. Three experiments were conducted by varying the vehicle fleet to measure the applicability of the model under different circumstances to decide on a better vehicle combination while minimizing total distribution time. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the composition of the vehicle fleet has a substantial influence on freshness levels and distribution times. Conclusions: Optimizing the distribution of fresh-cut flowers using VRP assists in reducing spoilage and waste by ensuring that flowers are transported under the best possible conditions. The application of this model holds immense value for floral companies as it offers assistance when planning their distribution network. Specifically, it can assist in identifying optimal routes that maximize freshness with minimum distribution time and an optimal set of vehicles. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.","fresh flower distribution; hybrid algorithms; perishability constraint, capacitated vehicle routing problem; perishable vehicle routing problem"

Furthermore, the algorithm uses BSO clustering operations to classify vehicle routes and facilitates mutual learning within and between classes through λ -interchange. The intra-class similarity expedites solution convergence, while the inter-class difference expands the search space to avoid local optima. Finally, the quality of the solution is enhanced through the application of the 2-opt operation.

DARP has been used in many modern applications, including the scheduling of demand-responsive transit and car pooling. This study departs from the original definition of DARP and it extends it by considering an interchange point where vehicles can exchange their picked-up passengers with other vehicles in order to shorten their delivery routes and reduce their running times. In addition to that, this study introduces the concept of generalized passenger travel times in the DARP formulation which translates the increased in-vehicle crowdedness to increased perceived passenger travel times. This addresses a key issue because the perceived in-vehicle travel times of passengers might increase when the vehicle becomes more crowded (i.e., passengers might feel that their travel time is higher when they are not able to find a seat or they are too close to each other increasing the risk of virus transmission or accidents). Given these considerations, this study introduces the Dial-a-Ride Problem with interchange and perceived travel times (DARPi) and models it as a nonlinear programming problem. DARPi is then reformulated to a MILP with the use of linearizations and its search space is tightened with the addition of valid inequalities that are employed when solving the problem to global optimality with Branch-and-Cut. For large problem instances, this study introduces a tabu search-based metaheuristic and performs experiments in benchmark instances used in past literature demonstrating the computation times and solution stability of our approach. The effect of the perceived passenger travel times to the vehicle running costs is also explored in extensive numerical experiments. © 2023 The Author(s)","Branch-and-cut; Multi-vehicle DARP; Tabu search; VRP with cross-docking"

In this regard, customers in an inconvenient location for one distribution company could be ideal for another company. Therefore, a set of distribution companies may shorten the delivery distance by combining urban distribution networks. The feeder vehicle routing problem (FVRP) is a new type of VRP to provide fast services in urban transportation. Unlike VRP, FVRP includes a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles (i.e., trucks and motorcycles) in which trucks and motorcycles move from the depot to serve customers. In this problem, motorcycles pass easily in crowded areas, and the traffic of urban logistics is distributed easily. Since returning to the depot and re-shipment to the customers increase cost and the distance traveled, one strategy to deal with this problem is applying the “joint” mechanism. In this mechanism, motorcycles visit the trucks rather than return to the depot at the joint points. Also, the feeder approach lowers the number of times the vehicle returns to the central depot for loading, resulting in cost and time savings. This study introduces a collaborative feeder vehicle routing problem with flexible time windows (CFVRPFlexTW) as a bi-objective model that simultaneously minimizes routing costs and maximizes customer satisfaction with a flexible time window. After modeling CFVRPFlexTW through mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), the augmented epsilon constraint (AEC) approach is applied in the CPLEX solver to solve the problem. Also, multi-objective particle swarm optimization with dynamic inertia weigh (WMOPSO) and MOPSO with adaptive learning strategy (LAMOPSO) were developed regarding the complexity of the problem. Then, their performance is compared with that of the Pareto solutions produced by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The computational outcomes indicate the outperformance of the WMOPSO based on some related metrics. Eventually, the AHP-TOPSIS method is applied to prioritize and analyze the algorithms. The results indicate the proposed LAMOPSO algorithm is more efficient in small-size instances. Furthermore, in large-size instances, the WMOPSO algorithm outperforms the MOPSO, LAMOPSO, LAWMOPSO, and NSGA-II algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptive learning strategy; Collaborative feeder vehicle routing problem; Flexible time windows; Multi-objective optimization; Particle swarm optimization"

However, uncertainty is inevitable in VRP. In this manuscript, we consider the VRP with time windows (VRPTW) under uncertainty. We formulate the robust multi-objective VRPTW (RMOVRPTW) model and propose a robust optimization algorithm based on MOEA/D (R-MOEAD-VRP) for simultaneously optimizing the total distance and the number of vehicles required for transport. First, we use the priority of the customers being served to encode and use the defined transformation approach to form the feasible routes. Next, we employ Order Crossover and Exchange mutation operators to increase population diversity. For the new routes by reproduction, we use Monte-Carlo tests to check the feasibility of the routes after adding uncertainty. For the feasible routes, we calculate the solution robustness values based on the defined method. Finally, we consider both optimality and robustness to form a set of highly robust and relatively optimal solutions. For verifying the availability of the presented algorithm, the simulation experiments conduct on Solomon’s benchmark problems compared with several related algorithms.

To solve the model, a DPSO (Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the basic principle of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) is proposed. The DPSO introduces multiple populations to handle multiple targets and uses a variable neighbourhood search strategy to improve the search ability of particles, which helps to improve the local search ability of the algorithm.

In this paper, a hyper-heuristic algorithm for large-scale VRPs is proposed. It uses the diversity of strategic space to improve the diversity of algorithms. In contrast, most of the current VPR optimisation methods only pay attention to the characteristics of solution space. The proposed algorithm consists of two layers, a high-level heuristic selection strategy and a low-level heuristic policy pool. The higherlevel strategy adjusts the algorithm s weight and guides the search direction dynamically based on the historical performance of the lower-level local search strategy. Simulation experiments show that, compared to the other two state-of-The-Art algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more stable and performs more efficiently under most GWKC instances.

This study addresses the complexity by aiming to automatically generate an optimal multi-day travel itinerary that satisfies user interests. The problem is framed as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (CVRPTW), and user interests are shaped by attributes such as rating and cost of points of interest (POIs), travel duration, the number of POIs in the itinerary, and penalty attributes (POI penalty and time penalty). The generated solution must adhere to constraints like daily travel duration limits and the operational hours of POIs. To ensure alignment with user interests, the Multi-Utility Attribute Theory (MAUT) is employed as the fitness function. This study proposes a VRP approach utilizing the hybrid Ant Colony System (ACS) and Brainstorm optimization (BSO) algorithm (the hybrid ACS-BSO) for multi-day travel itinerary generation, addressing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach limitations. The hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms conventional algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), and Simulated Annealing (SA), across 5 sets of random POIs with an average fitness value of 0.6704. moreover, the hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms the other conventional algorithms in optimizing each attribute. In terms of travel duration attribute, the hybrid ACS-BSO generate an itinerary requiring only 6 days to visit 40 POIs, while the other algorithms need 7 days. In terms of cost and rating attributes, the hybrid ACS-BSO achieves the best fitness values compared to the others. Furthermore, the hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms the standalone algorithms (ACS and BSO) across varying numbers of POIs, but it faces a maximum 311 seconds running time for 87 POIs, indicating a time complexity weakness. Comparatively, ACS, BSO, and the hybrid ACS-BSO in VRP approach surpass their TSP counterparts, affirming the effectiveness of the VRP approach. © (2024) Intelligent Network and Systems Society.","Ant colony system algorithm; Hybrid ant colony system and brainstorm optimization; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multi-day travel itinerary; Recommender system"

It has been observed that the original crab mating algorithm gives successful results; however, works very slowly and there are some parameters that are not used in the algorithm, and the mating probability of crabs converges to either 100% or 0%. Considering that the crab mating algorithm gives good results, new crab versions have been developed from this algorithm. The improved crab algorithms are compared with 4 popular metaheuristic algorithms for 20 different benchmark functions on metrics, such as mean, standard deviation, optimality, accuracy, run time, and the number of function evaluations (NFE).

In the extreme conditions, such as disaster-stricken zones, the difficulty of vehicle movement between nearest different affected areas (demand points) on planning routes cause the imprecision of time of movement and the uncertainty of feasibility of movement. In this paper, the imprecision is presented by triangular fuzzy numbers and the uncertainty is presented by a possibility measure. A new two-stage, fuzzy bi-criterion optimization approach for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is considered. On the first stage, the sample of so-called ""promising""closed routes are selected based on a ""constructive""approach. On the second stage, triangular fuzzy valued Choquet aggregation (TFCA) operator is constructed for the selected closed routes. The evaluation of constructed routes, levels of failure and possibility of vehicle movement on the roads are aggregated by the TFCA operator by the new criterion - minimization of infeasibility of movement. The new criterion together with the classic criterion - minimization of the total distance traveled - creates a bi-criteria fuzzy VRP. The constructed VRP is reduced to the bi-criteria fuzzy partitioning problem, and an e-constraint approach is developed for solving it. For numerical experiments, a parallel algorithm is created on the basis of D. Knuth's algorithm of Dancing Links (DLX). An example is presented with the results of our approach for the VRP, where all Pareto-optimal solutions are found from the set of promising routes. The optimal solutions tend to avoid roads that are problematic because of extreme situations.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Choquet integral; fuzzy measure; fuzzy numbers; Multi-criteria vehicle routing problem; Pareto solution; partitioning problem; possibility measure"

An optimum design of the pharmaceutical supply chain is critical to avoid economic damage and adverse effects on human health. The vehicle-routing problem, focused on finding the lowest-cost routes with available vehicles and constraints, such as time constraints and road length, is an important aspect of this. In this paper, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for a pharmaceutical company in Turkey is discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model based on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is presented, aiming to minimize the total route cost with certain constraints. As the model provides an optimum solution for small problem sizes with the GUROBI® solver, for large problem sizes, metaheuristic methods that simulate annealing and adaptive large neighborhood search algorithms are proposed. A real dataset was used to analyze the effectiveness of the metaheuristic algorithms. The proposed simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) were evaluated and compared against GUROBI® and each other through a set of real problem instances. Findings: The model is solved optimally for a small-sized dataset with exact algorithms; for solving a larger dataset, however, metaheuristic algorithms require significantly lesser time. For the problem addressed in this study, while the metaheuristic algorithms obtained the optimum solution in less than one minute, the solution in the GUROBI® solver was limited to one hour and three hours, and no solution could be obtained in this time interval. Originality/value: The VRPTW problem presented in this paper is a real-life problem.

VRP has a vast range of application fields such as transportation, logistics, manufacturing, relief systems and communication. To suit the needs of different real-world VRP scenarios, many models of VRP have been developed — CVRP (Capacitated VRP) being the classical form. In this article, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, ICAHGS, is proposed for solving CVRP. The present study proposes a refined Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) as the primary evolutionary and multi-population method for addressing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). In order to further optimize the search process, a Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS-CVRP) algorithm is applied as an enhanced local search and population management strategy within the ICA framework. Additionally, the internal restart step of the HGS-CVRP algorithm is replaced with a multi-step restart mechanism for intensification improvement. One notable aspect of the proposed method is its ability to facilitate parallel processing, with each empire able to be processed on a separate processor. This structure allows for increased computational efficiency in addressing the CVRP. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it has been compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature.

Such a problem involves the interplay among the operations that leads to NP-hard problems with complex constraints. Hence, existing methods for AGH are usually designed with massive domain knowledge but still fail to yield high-quality solutions efficiently. In this paper, we aim to enhance the solution quality and computation efficiency for solving AGH. Particularly, we first model AGH as a multiple-fleet vehicle routing problem (VRP) with miscellaneous constraints including precedence, time windows, and capacity. Then we propose a construction framework that decomposes AGH into sub-problems (i.e., VRPs) in fleets and present a neural method to construct the routing solutions to these sub-problems. In specific, we resort to deep learning and parameterize the construction heuristic policy with an attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction heuristics and the specialized methods for AGH. Besides, we empirically verify that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of flights or varying parameters, and can be readily adapted to solve real-time AGH with stochastic flight arrivals.

As the initial stage for such constructing purposes, it is required to drill wells for construction piles. To this end, there is a fleet of mobile drilling rigs traveling from one exploration site to another, performing the work on drilling wells. For each site, we have a time window for completing all the work on drilling. To complete all the work among all the exploration sites in time, it may be necessary to allow several drilling rigs to perform work at the same site. Yet, in the real world, unforeseen circumstances can affect drilling time, and that, if disregarded, can lead to a disruption of the work plan. Thus, in this problem, we maximize possible deviations of drilling times from expected values when there is still a feasible solution to perform all well-drilling requests in time. At the same time, total traveling costs must be no more than a given threshold. It is a so-called threshold robustness approach. The described Drilling Rig Routing Problem (DRRP) differs from other well-studied variants of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in that the work splitting affects the service time. There is a limited number of papers dealing with such problems and no papers about the robust formulation for them. This research proposes a mathematical model for the novel formulation of the DRRP with uncertainties and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to solve it. The destruction operators work either at the route, customer, or visit level. The reconstruction operators take into account a possibility to change the work partition. Computational results for the algorithm and Gurobi solver show the dominance of the ALNS scheme for medium- and large-sized instances. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Logistics; Metaheuristics; Split delivery; Threshold robustness; Time windows; Uncapacitated vehicles"

The implementation of these algorithms plays a crucial role in achieving favorable outcomes with the available resources. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been a central topic in distribution and logistics for decades. New VRP models and tools are developed to address the challenges of modern logistics. The Energy Minimizing Vehicle Routing Problem (EMVRP) is a 'green'-oriented variant of the VRP where the objective is to minimize the total amount of energy consumed by a fleet of vehicles. The VRP literature has focused on solving the problem using a variety of approaches and techniques, including exact methods, heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid algorithms. Hybrid algorithms combine different techniques to obtain more effective and better solutions. This work presents four innovative hybrid algorithms to address the EMVRP problem. These algorithms combine Machine Learning (ML) clustering techniques with metaheuristic approaches inspired by an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed algorithms are: Free Ant + K-Means, Free Ant + K-Medoids, Restricted Ant + K-Means, and Restricted Ant + K-Medoids. Each of them combines the benefits of clustering with the optimization capacity of ACO. Proposed algorithms were subjected to testing using instances from CVRPLIB. Both Free Ant and Restricted Ant efficiently solved EMVRP problems. The results obtained were analyzed and compared with the proposals of other authors in the literature. Overall, the results are promising, but they also indicate a significant scope for experimentation and parameter tuning of the proposed algorithms.  © 2013 IEEE.","Complex problems; free ant; green-vrp; heuristics; k-means; k-medoids; machine learning; metaheuristics; restricted ant; vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

The knowledge sharing strategy promotes cross-task insights and solutions, enhancing concurrent optimization. The resource sharing strategy aligns computational efforts with task progression, optimizing efficiency. The search sharing strategy prioritizes elite solutions and intensifies local searches, thereby increasing diversity and effectiveness. These combined strategies create a cohesive framework that improves optimization: informed resource allocation refines the search process, initiating a cycle that boosts TSEMTA's performance.

In this paper, we investigate a form of SBRP where each passenger has a well-ordered set of preferred stops, e.g., the preferences can be based on the distance to their destination. The passengers continue their journey from the stop to their destination by an alternative mode, such as walking. Different drop-off choices allow for a different set of passengers to be dropped off together, affecting the total vehicle driving distance. As the transport provider and passengers have their own objectives, inevitably, there are two opposing goals (tradeoff aspects), reducing total driving distance versus passenger walking distance. Unlike typical SBRP, we focus on practical problems where the set of passengers is not known well in advance and there is only a short time window to compute a solution (a real-time requirement). Hence, runtime efficiency is more important than optimality. We introduce this variant as SBRP-RT, a school bus routing problem with tradeoff aspects and real-time requirements.

The VRP aims to find an optimal tour that has least total distance (or cost) to provide service to n customers (or nodes or cities) utilizing m vehicles so that every vehicle starts journey from and ends journey at a depot (headquarters) and visits every customer only once. The problem has many variations, and we consider the ADVRP for this study, where distance traveled by every vehicle must not exceed a predefined maximum distance.

The HGAs enhance the initial solution using 2-opt search method and incorporate a local search technique along with an immigration procedure to obtain effective solution to the ADVRP.

To solve VRP, traditional optimization methods usually start the search from scratch and ignore the VRPs solved in the past, which could lead to repeated explorations of the search space of related problems, and thus results in slow optimization process involving unnecessary computational cost. Keeping this in mind, to speed up the optimization for vehicle routing, this article presents a new study towards faster vehicle routing by transferring knowledge from customer representations which are learned from past solved VRPs. In particular, we propose to capture the useful traits buried in previous optimized routing solutions by learning a new customer representation, which can be transferred across VRPs, serving as the prior knowledge, to bias the optimization in the target VRP. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed knowledge transfer is consist of a learning of new customer representation based on the optimized routing solution, which is general to VRPs possessing different structural properties, and a weighted l{1} norm-regularized formulation for building sparse mapping across VRPs, that is easy to solve. Further, the proposed knowledge transfer across VRPs occurs along the whole optimization search process, and is thus able to guide the routing optimization process consistently. To verify the efficacy of the proposed method, by using population-based optimization method as the VRP solver, comprehensive empirical studies on both commonly used VRP benchmarks and real world vehicle routing application are presented.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.","knowledge transfer; population-based search; transfer optimization; Vehicle routing"

The great interest in the VRP is due to its practical importance, as well as the difficulty in solving it. The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is the most common variant of the VRP. Most of the approaches that have been developed to solve this problem tend to solve the problem in a centralized way. There has been very little research done into solving this problem in a distributed manner. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for solving CVRP in a distributed manner based on multi-agent systems and using the game theory, which consists of three types of intelligent agents: customer agent, vehicle agent, and depot agent and includes the two phases: cluster construction and clusters optimization. The cluster construction phase consists of playing a Game Theoretic Clustering Algorithm by customer agents to divide the customers into several clusters, each consisting of a cluster head and several member customers. Then, we present a Game Theoretic Clusters Optimization Algorithm for the cluster optimization phase, which is played by vehicle agents to minimize the cost of each vehicle’s route to optimize the quality of the solution. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on 48 instances from 10 standard benchmark sets and compared with some state-of-the-art methods in terms of execution time and quality of solutions.

Collaboration and transportation resource sharing are adopted to optimize vehicle routes in the CMVRPTWMDP, to integrate the delivery and pickup services with time windows, and to construct open–closed mixed vehicle routes. First, the CMVRPTWMDP is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model to minimize logistics operating costs. The effect of transportation resource sharing on reducing the number of needed vehicles and the maintenance cost is considered in the model formulation. Second, a two-stage hybrid algorithm combining customer clustering and vehicle routing optimization is designed to solve the CMVRPTWMDP. An improved 3D k-means clustering algorithm based on space–time distances and the customer demand is proposed to reassign customers to logistics facilities (e.g., delivery or pickup centers). Furthermore, a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, called GA–PSO, is designed to optimize the vehicle routes. A coordination operator between GA and PSO is designed to allow particles and chromosomes to interact, increasing the diversity of particle swarms and the possibility of finding a feasible solution.

In light of the uncertainty of customers in logistics distribution and the widely applied two-dimensional loading patterns in transportation, we propose and formulate a two-dimensional loading-constrained vehicle routing problem with stochastic customers (2L-VRPSC), where each customer has a known probability of presence and customers’ demands are a set of non-stackable items. A stochastic modeling platform of 2L-VRPSC is established based on a Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis to minimize the expected total transportation cost. To achieve this, an enhanced adaptive tabu search (EATS) algorithm incorporating the multi-order bottom-fill-skyline (MOBFS) packing heuristic is proposed, where the EATS algorithm searches for the optimal routing combination and the MOBFS checks the feasibility of each route and guides the EATS to search for feasible solutions. The widely used two-dimensional loading-constrained vehicle routing problem (2L-VRP) benchmarks under different loading configurations considering items’ sequential and rotation constraints are applied for experiments, which demonstrates the comparable efficiency of the proposed EATS-MOBFS for solving 2L-VRP. Furthermore, the results and analysis of experiments based on the new 2L-VRPSC instances verify the versatility of the proposed solving approach, which is capable of providing more practical solutions to some real-life scenarios with customers’ uncertain information. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive tabu search; customer uncertainty; loading constraints; scenario simulation; vehicle routing"

Considering the differences in the starting points of vehicles, the VRP of general logistics, and departments of vehicles, constraints, such as vehicle capacity limitation and time windows, were introduced into the model, which was close to meeting the practical demands of emergency relief. A hybrid code genetic algorithm (HCGA) was proposed, and it used dynamic mutations to avoid early traps in local optimization and to accelerate convergence. This algorithm was programmed by MATLAB. Furthermore, the vehicle routing optimization plans in an emergency was calculated by a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) and the HCGA, respectively. Results demonstrate that the total time for relief distribution in the HCGA is 11.62 % lower and the calculation time is 14.24 % shorter than that of the SGA.

The constraints that are typically imposed for school buses are bus capacity, a maximum student walking distance to a pickup point, and a maximum commute time for each student. This is a special case of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a common destination. We propose a decomposition approach for solving this problem based on the existing notion of a shareability network, which has been used recently in the context of dynamic ridepooling problems. Moreover, we come up with a simplified formulation for solving the SSRP by introducing the connection between the SSRP and the weighted set covering problem (WSCP). To scale this method to large-scale problem instances, we propose (i) a node compression method for the shareability network based decomposition approach, and (ii) heuristic-based edge pruning techniques that perform well in practice. We show that the compressed problem leads to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) of reduced dimensionality that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf ILP solvers. Numerical experiments on the synthetic Boston Public School (BPS) instances are conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach. Meanwhile, our proposed SSRP formulation allows a natural extension for introducing alternate transportation modes to students, which effectively reduces the number of buses needed for each school and leads to a 15% cost reduction on average. Moreover, two state-of-art large-scale SSRP solving techniques are compared with our proposed approaches on benchmark networks and our methods outperform both techniques under a single school setting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposition approach; Shareability network; Single school routing problem"

Considering the complex traffic elements and road network topological structure in logistics and distribution, in the first stage, a heuristic simulated annealing (HSA) distribution region partitioning algorithm is proposed with the objective of balancing vehicle task load to divide the urban logistics distribution network under complex road networks, so as to reduce the region scale and path search cost. In the second stage of route decision making, aiming at minimizing the total cost of logistics distribution, combining the VRP problem with complex road network conditions, a heuristic path search method combined with complex road network model constraints is proposed. In this stage, a hybrid genetic beam search(HGBS) algorithm is used to plan the path nodes, reduce the randomness of the model in the initial search for paths by heuristic genetic algorithms, then combine with Beam Search methods to reduce the space and time used for the search, and use optimization algorithms to improve the accuracy of independent sub-region routing optimization and the rationality of overall physical distribution route selection. Finally, the proposed method is validated in this paper with two practical cases. The experimental results show that the two-stage decision-making algorithm proposed in this paper has certain advantages in partitioning schemes, minimizing total cost and iteration times.

This paper discusses the use of biological intelligence in analysis and optimization on MDVRP-TW. The objective of the MDVRP-TW is to minimize the overall distance, means of transportation within a specified time gap, along with other constraints such as limitation of vehicle capacity, restrictions of route duration length to satisfy the customer's requirements. The routes must be designed where each customer is visited only once in a particular time gap with one vehicle and all the routes must originate and end at the same depot. The overall demand should not go beyond the vehicle's capacity on each route. Multi-objective problems have attracted the attentions of many researchers in recent years, as they are more closely related to real-world situations. However, transportation is a significant factor for the current society, exhibiting and planning a complicated transport system was a very thought-provoking task. Many research studies have shown several successful metaheuristics and heuristic methodologies to solve MDVRP-TW in which, instead of a single depot, numerous depots with varying locations. In this work considered both the earliest time and latest arrival time window (double-sided time window). It is assumed that if an arrival time is more significant than the latest time, it will lead to an infeasible solution whereas, if an arrival time is lesser than the earliest time, then it will lead to a waiting time. However, due to its challenging task and multi-objective and limitations, there is still a space to solve it. In this work, a novel technique that combines an improved firefly algorithm (IFA), which uses different mechanisms, namely, inter-depot approach in assignment phase, Clarke & wright algorithm, and local search method in routing and scheduling phase were applied. The suggested technique has been evaluated using Cordeau standard benchmark instances and proved the technique's novelty and feasibility.

In extreme situations, the complexity of the description of vehicles’ movement on routes may cause by two poles: the imprecision of movement time and the uncertainty of the possibility of movement on roads. Traditionally, a fuzzy value has been used to represent the data’s impreciseness; hence, only one pole of expert’s information is taken in the aggregation results. The main objective of this paper is to present an efficient way for fuzzy vehicle routing modeling to minimize the decision-making risks in the optimal planning of routes network and from distribution centers to demand points. To address this, a new two-stage possibilistic bi-criteria vehicle routing problem (VRP) is presented under extreme conditions. In the first stage, the sample of so-called “promising” closed routes are selected based on a “constructive” approach using a simulation algorithm. The expected times of the vehicle movement between demand points are taken as fuzzy triangular numbers. In the second stage, based on Choquet integral’s, a bi-criteria partitioning model for the fuzzy VRP has been constructed.

This requires suppliers to face a huge and complex problem of delivering products that meet the needs of their customers on a daily basis. It also puts great pressure on managers on how to make day-to-day decisions quickly and efficiently to both satisfy customer requirements and satisfy capacity constraints. This study proposes a combination of the cluster-first – route-second method and k-means clustering algorithm to deal with a large Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) in the logistics and transportation field. The purpose of this research is to assist decision-makers to make quick and efficient decisions, based on optimal costs, the number of vehicles, delivery time, and truck capacity efficiency. A distribution system of perishable goods in Vietnam is used as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of our mathematical model. In particular, perishable goods include fresh products of fish, chicken, beef, and pork. These products are packed in different sizes and transferred by vehicles with 1000 kg capacity. Besides, they are delivered from a depot to the main 39 customers of the company with arrival times following customers’ time window. All of the data are collected from a logistics company in Ho Chi Minh city (Vietnam). The result shows that the application of the clustering algorithm reduces the time for finding the optimal solutions. Especially, it only takes an average of 0.36 s to provide an optimal solution to a large Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with 39 nodes. In addition, the number of trucks, their operating costs, and their utilization are also shown fully. The logistics company needs 11 trucks to deliver their products to 39 customers. The utilization of each truck is more than 70%. This operation takes the total costs of 6586215.32 VND (Vietnamese Dong), of which, the transportation cost is 1086215.32 VND. This research mainly contributes an effective method for enterprises to quickly find the optimal solution to the problem of product supply. © 2022 The Author(s).

The addition of charging stations at the existing power network introduces a greater challenge on voltage stability and losses. The effect of the charging station can be addressed through the optimal integration of Distributed Generation (DG) units into the network. The improper placement of DG units can jeopardize the network stability. These issues are addressed by optimal placement of DG units and charging stations in the network to improve voltage, reduce transmission loss and maximize the charging station capacity. Here the objectives are considered as a multi-objective problem and solved using an enhanced Ant-lion optimization algorithm.

Different from the general VRP model, the unique characteristics of our model are: (1) two types of products are delivered, and the demand for them is interdependent and based on a bill of materials (BOM); (2) the paper considers a new aspect in customer satisfaction, i.e., the consideration of the production efficiency on the customer side. In our model, customer satisfaction is not measured by the actual customer waiting time, but by the weighted customer waiting time, which is based on the targeted service rate of the end products. We define the targeted service rate as the ratio of the quantity of the end product produced by the corresponding delivery quantities of the two products to the demand of the end product. We propose a hybrid ant colony-genetic optimization algorithm to solve this model with actual data from a case study of the State Grid Corporation of China.

The HCSPSPDTW is a bi-objective problem where the traveled time and distance should be minimized. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach for solving the HCSPSPDTW: the inner optimization problem solved by the k-means++ clustering algorithm, asks for finding the closest visits in terms of distance to avoid long travels.

However, due to the limited AFV driving range and since the Alternative Fuel Stations (AFSs) are usually not widespread on the territory, the routes of AFVs have to be properly planned in order to prevent them from remaining without the sufficient fuel to reach the depot or the closest station. The Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP) aims at determining the AFVs routes, each one serving customers within a maximum duration, minimizing the total travel distance and, if necessary, including stops at AFSs. Contrary to G-VRP, G-VRP with Capacitated AFSs (G-VRP-CAFS) more realistically assumes that each AFS has a limited number of fueling pumps and therefore prevents overlapping in refueling operations.

The VRP is usually solved by using branch and bound techniques requiring solving a shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC) and the determination of a lower bound, which can be computed by using column generation. The SPPRC entails finding the minimum cost elementary path in a valuated graph that is subject to constraints on resource consumption. The proposed exact solutions to this hard NP-hard problem require an excessive computation time which increases with the number of resources. In this paper, we propose a new approximate resolution of the SPPRC for acyclic and cyclic graphs. Our method is based on a Lagrangian relaxation of a subset of the constraints and using dominance only on a subset of the resources. This reduces the search space and allows users to effciently compute solutions used to improve the column generation procedure. Extensive evaluation and comparison to the classical exact method show that the proposed algorithm achieves a good compromise between effciency and quality of the SPPRC and the VRP solutions. Thus, our method can be used for practical large-scale VRP applications. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

To solve these difficulties, many studies have considered learning-based optimization (LBO) algorithms to solve the VRP. This paper reviews recent advances in this field and divides relevant approaches into end-to-end approaches and step-by-step approaches.

The MEP models routing and scheduling as ‘equivalent’ partitioning or clustering problems with side-constraints, and employs tools from statistical physics for assigning resources (routes/vehicles) to each node such that the resource allocation results in feasible, sub-optimal routes. The MEP can flexibly incorporate side-constraints related to minimum tour-lengths, capacities, schedules and reachability (like CETSP). Analytically, our model results in a second-order non-linear system of complex implicit equations. We show that an iterative approach effectively solves these equations, is equivalent to a gradient descent and converges to a local minimum. Despite the non-linear optimization model, the algorithm converges to an integer optimal solution. Computationally, we compare our approach to Simulated Annealing (SA), the CMT-14 benchmarks for VRP and benchmarks for CETSP. Our approach consistently outperforms SA for multiple variants of routing problems, specifically, the CVRP, VRPTW and CETSP. On the CMT-14 benchmark instances, our approach finds the optimal (when verifiable) number of vehicles, with a cumulative tour distance within 6.2% on average, and in comparable computation times of the best-known solutions (over all approaches for each instance). We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark instances of the CETSP and discuss our results. This demonstrates the potential of our MEP approach to be further embedded into hybridization heuristics for further improved results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Close-enough traveling salesman problem; Maximum Entropy Principle; Statistical physics; Unified heuristics; VRP"

The related decision process takes into account some passenger-side time window-related requirements, walking limits, the availability and capacities of various types of buses. A mixed-integer linear programming model of this new VRP variant with floating targets (passengers) is formulated.

A solution to a vehicle routing problem that considers congestion and energy consumption of SAEVs is proposed to assist green transportation under poor traffic conditions. In addition to routing the fleet of SAEVs to serve customers, the proposed method also determines the vehicle speed in each arc and the departure time at each node by minimizing the cost considering the travel distance, energy consumption, and travel time. In the time-dependent vehicle routing problem with departure time and speed optimization for SAEV service (SAEV-TD-VRP-DSO), the electric vehicles (EVs) exchange batteries at battery swapping stations (BSSs), and the corresponding vehicle routing method also includes recharge scheduling. We develop a mixed-integer linear model (MILP) to formulate the SAEV-TD-VRP-DSO and show that the state-of-the-art commercial optimization solver (CPLEX) can only solve a few instances (no more than 8 requests). Thus, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed to find near-optimal solutions for larger-size instances. The removal and insertion operators of ALNS help optimize the node sequences. A departure time and speed optimization procedure (DSOP) is employed to optimize the speed and departure time in each arc. The good performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using instance sets. The optimization results of a case study in the Yanta Administrative District in Xi'an, China, show that speed and departure time optimization result in 24.99% cost savings. The sensitivity analysis results provide the SAEV operators with alternative cost-saving solutions. Empty vehicles traveling at a slower speed can reduce energy cost. The total cost of operating vehicles with passengers can be reduced by avoiding congestion and utilizing larger capacity batteries (32 kWh or more) and a lower minimum battery level (0.2-0.3). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","adaptive large neighborhood search; autonomous vehicles; departure time and speed optimization; electric vehicles; Shared vehicles; time-dependent vehicle routing"

Unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones are an emerging technology that are very useful to cope with rising customer expectations of fast, flexible, and reliable delivery services. Drones work in tandem with trucks to perform parcel delivery, which have proven to reduce costs, CO2 emissions, and delivery times. This research proposes a mixed integer programming formulation to address the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone (VRPD) by assigning customers to drone-truck pairs, determining the number of dispatching drone-truck units, and obtaining optimal service routes while the fixed and travel costs of both vehicles are minimized. Given the NP-hard nature of the VRPD, an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is elaborated to solve this problem. Two novel methods are proposed to investigate the efficiency of the drone-truck combination by allowing the drones to perform additional delivery services to only one feasible customer and also multiple feasible customers while the truck waits at a customer location. Experimental results show that the proposed ACO algorithm can effectively solve the VRDP for different size instances and different customer location distributions, and is successful in providing timely solutions for small test instances within 1% of the optimal solutions. Finally, experimentation also reveals that the ACO algorithm outperforms the classical VRP by obtaining cost-savings of over 30% for large instances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heuristic; Optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Urban delivery; Vehicle routing problem"

However, all the previously studied variants assume that vehicles are mostly the same in terms of their capacity, location and home location (depot). This study uses the agent-based approach for solving VRPTW with vehicle's unique location and depot. This is to minimise the number of used vehicles as the main target. Other targets including total distance travelled, waiting time and time are also considered as criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated vehicle routes. This is achieved by proposing a Messaging Protocol-based Heuristics Optimisation (MPHO) model that balances between centrally-distributed agents’ interactions and accommodates certain priority rules specifically developed for the problem. Furthermore, modifications to certain constraints checking techniques are introduced by implementing time Push Forward (PF) checking recursively tailored to the route's unique start/ending locations as well as calculating the reduced waiting time to find and check the limit of the total route duration. In order to justify the superiority of the proposed MPHO model, numerical tests have been conducted on benchmark problems including single and multiple depot instances as well as modified instances tailored to the problem. This is made possible by randomising vehicles’ capacities and their unique locations and depots. Key results reveal that, in multiple depot instances, higher quality solutions compared with previous benchmark outcomes are obtained in terms of minimising the total number of vehicles along with fastest solution time (CPU) at the expense of total time and distance travelled. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Hybrid messaging protocol; Optimisation; Unique vehicle location and depot; Vehicle Routing Problem"

Every e-commerce application offers the convenience and choices needed by the community. The Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) model has been widely developed in recent years. 2E-VRP makes it possible for customers to combine shipments from several different stores due to satellites in their distribution stream. The aim of this paper is to optimize a two-echelon logistics distribution network for package delivery on e-commerce platforms, where vans operate in the first echelon and motorcycles operate in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as 2E-VRP, where total travel costs and fuel consumption are minimized. This optimization is based on determining the flow in each echelon and choosing the optimal routing solution for vans and motorcycles. Methods: This paper proposes a combination of the K-means Clustering Algorithm and the 2-opt Algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Many previous studies have used the K-means algorithm to help streamline the search for solutions. In the solution series, clustering is carried out between the satellite and the customer in the first echelon using the K-means algorithm. To determine the optimal k-cluster, we analyzed it using the silhouette, gap statistic, and elbow methods. Furthermore, the routing at each echelon is solved by the 2-opt heuristic method. At the end of the article, we present testing of several instances with the different number of clusters. The study results indicate an influence on the determination of the number of clusters in minimizing the objective function. Results: This paper looks at 100 customers, 10 satellites, and 1 depot. By working in two stages, the first stage is the resolution of satellite and customer problems, and the second stage is the resolution of problems between the satellite and the depots. We compare distance and cost solutions with a different number of k-clusters. From the test results, the number of k-clusters shows an effect of number and distance on the solution. Conclusions: In the 2E-VRP model, determining the location of the cluster between the satellite and the customer is very important in preparing the delivery schedule in logistics distribution within the city. The benefit is that the vehicle can divide the destination according to the location characteristics of the satellite and the customer, although setting the how many clusters do not guarantee obtaining the optimal distance. And the test results also show that the more satellites there are, the higher the shipping costs. For further research, we will try to complete the model with the metaheuristic genetic algorithm method and compare it with the 2-opt heuristic method. © 2022, Poznan School of Logistics.

The heuristic proposed in this work is an efficient hybrid of a novice Local Search (LS), Ruin and Recreate procedure (R&R) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed LS acts as the initial solution finder as well as the engine for finding a feasible/local optimum. While PSO helps in moving from current best solution to the next best solution, the R&R part allows the solution to be over-optimized and LS moves the solution back on the feasible side. To test our heuristic, we solved 56 benchmark instances of 25, 50, and 100 customers and found that our heuristics can find 52, 21, and 18 optimal cases, respectively.

The algorithms are used to solve a set of real instances for a courier company in China. For such large-scale problems, the improved ABC algorithm performs significantly better than the basic ABC algorithm without the route repair procedure. This study further analyses the sensitivity of the results to the values assigned to a series of weighting coefficients on the constraints and objectives. This provides the company with flexibility in its operations under different operating circumstances.

In this paper, VRP-D is extended to include a fleet of drones equipped with multi-package payload compartments to serve more customers on a single trip. Moreover, a drone can return to a truck, different from the one from which it started, to swap its depleted battery and/or to pick up more packages. This problem, denoted as VRP-D equipped with multi-package payload compartments (VRP-D-MC), aims to maximize total profit. In this work, an adaptive multi-start simulated annealing (AMS-SA) metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve this problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms for VRP-D in terms of solution quality. Extensive analyses have been conducted to provide managerial insights. The analyses carried out show (i) the benefits of using drones equipped with different compartment configurations, (ii) the incremental total profit obtainable using a combined truck-drone fleet rather than a fleet of trucks, (iii) the benefit of swapping drone battery while picking up the items to deliver, and (iv) the impact of the packages load on the consumption energy of battery drone. It is also demonstrated that the different intensification and diversification mechanisms adopted improve the convergence of the traditional SA. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Multi payload compartments; Multi start approach; Simulated Annealing; Vehicle routing problem with drones"

This problem can range from a simple scenario involving one source, one material and one destination to a more challenging and complex case involving multiple sources, multiple materials and multiple destinations. This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-supported active building information modeling (BIM) system for optimized multi-project ready-mix concrete (RMC) delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The presented system is BIM-based, IoT supported, dynamic and automatic input/output exchange to provide an optimal delivery program for multi-project ready-mix-concrete problem. The input parameters are extracted as real-time map-supported IoT data and transferred to the system via an application programming interface (API) into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model developed to perform the optimization. The obtained optimization results are further integrated into BIM by conventional project management tools. To demonstrate the features of the suggested system, an RMCDP example was applied to solve that included four building sites, seven eligible concrete plants and three necessary RMC mixtures. Findings: The system provides the optimum delivery schedule for multiple RMCs to multiple construction sites, as well as the optimum RMC quantities to be delivered, the quantities from each concrete plant that must be supplied, the best delivery routes, the optimum execution times for each construction site, and the total minimal costs, while also assuring the dynamic transfer of the optimized results back into the portfolio of multiple BIM projects. The system can generate as many solutions as needed by updating the real-time input parameters in terms of change of the routes, unit prices and availability of concrete plants. Originality/value: The suggested system allows dynamic adjustments during the optimization process, andis adaptable to changes in input data also considering the real-time input data. The system is based on spreadsheets, which are widely used and common tool that most stakeholders already utilize daily, while also providing the possibility to apply a more specialized tool. Based on this, the RMCDP can be solved using both conventional and advanced optimization software, enabling the system to handle even large-scale tasks as necessary. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active building information modeling; BIM; Internet of things; IoT; Multi-project environment; Optimization; Ready-mix-concrete delivery; RMC"

Multi-depot model of vehicle routing has sparked widespread interest among researchers as an effective means of reducing cost comprising carbon emissions, fuel consumption, vehicles rental, and driver salaries. In this paper, we developed an improved adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm to efficiently solve large-scale instances of the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem with time windows (MDGVRPTW), based on the characteristics of the multi-depot model, and the formulation of carbon emissions from customers. For the destroy operation, three problem-specific destroy operators that took advantage of the structure of the multi-depot model and the calculation formula of carbon emissions, were deliberately tailored for the MDGVRPTW. The operators could rapidly remove customers causing significant carbon emissions, which enabled these customers to be better positioned in future repair operations. For the repair operation, a noise-greedy repair operator was proposed to enhance the diversification capabilities of the ALNS. Additionally, two methods for speeding up the repair process were proposed to improve computational time. Computational experiments revealed that the proposed ALNS algorithm exhibited a significant improvement in calculation speed and accuracy compared with existing algorithms. © 2022","Adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm; Carbon emissions; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

These variants determine the respective depot locations from which customers are supplied, i.e., the two-echelon VRP (2E-VRP), the location routing problem (LRP), and the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). Both the LRP and the MDVRP can be formulated as special cases of the 2E-VRP, so that all three problem classes can be readily solved via a single solution approach. We develop such a unified solution approach for all three problem classes based on the recently proposed hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (HALNS). The HALNS uses a population of solutions generated by an efficient ALNS. Individuals of this population are subject to a crossover and selection phase, using elements of genetic algorithms resulting in a hybrid heuristic. Computational experiments on several sets of instances from literature demonstrate the competitive performance of the HALNS. The HALNS outperforms all approaches for solving the 2E-VRP and is on par with heuristics that are dedicated either to the LRP or the MDVRP. Furthermore, the HALNS shows superior robustness, i.e., the variance of results from several runs is comparatively low. The HALNS especially outperforms all existing pure ALNS implementations on these problem classes, demonstrating the value of hybridization. Additionally, the HALNS finds three new best-known solutions for LRP instances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Location routing problem; Metaheuristics; Multi-depot vehicle routing problem; Two-echelon vehicle routing problem"

To address this challenging issue, we leverage a novel neural network integrated with a heterogeneous attention mechanism to empower the policy in deep reinforcement learning to automatically select the nodes. In particular, the heterogeneous attention mechanism specifically prescribes attentions for each role of the nodes while taking into account the precedence constraint, i.e., the pickup node must precede the pairing delivery node.

The former is only effective for small problem instances while the latter is more suitable for practical applications with larger scale. However, these methods perform evolutionary search only on a single problem form of VRP, while the efficient problem form of a given VRP is often unknown before hand. Keeping the above in mind, this paper proposes memetic search with evolutionary multitasking for solving vehicle routing problem on multiple problem forms. In particular, multiple simplified vehicle routing problems are firstly constructed and acted as the auxiliary tasks of original VRP. The memetic evolutionary search is thus simultaneously performed on simplified vehicle routing problems and original VRP. In this way, the useful routing traits can be shared by knowledge transfer among the tasks to enhance the evolutionary search.

To capture the uncertainty characteristics in a real-life scenario, we design a new form of disturbance on travel time and construct robust multiobjective VRP with the time window, where the perturbation range of travel time is determined by the maximum disturbance degree. Two conflicting objectives include: 1)the minimization of both the total distance and: 2)the number of vehicles. A robust multiobjective particle swarms optimization approach is developed by incorporating an advanced encoding and decoding scheme, a robustness measurement metric, as well as the local search strategy. First, through particle flying in the decision space, the problem space characteristic under deterministic environment is fully exploited to provide guidance for robust optimization. Then, a designed metric is adopted to measure the robustness of solutions and help to search for the robust optimal solutions during the particle flying process. In addition to the updating process of particle, two local search strategies, problem-based local search and route-based local search, are developed for further improving the performance of solutions. For comparison, we develop several robust optimization problems by adding disturbances on selected benchmark problems.

As our new approach shows, the VRP can be used to model in-plant and out-plant material handling and out-plant passenger transport. The Vehicle Routing Problem is a complex, multi-component heterogeneous environment, where consistent handling and integrity of components is a more difficult problem.

While it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution of 2E-VRP, this study finds a breakthrough that the structure of the optimal route planning for 2E-VRP is usually an embedded Hamiltonian graph. In the graph, routes can be drawn in a planar graph as Hamiltonian circuits without intersections. Based on this finding, an embedded Hamiltonian graph-guided heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve 2E-VRP. As a crucial part of the algorithm, an initialization scheme is designed to search for the farthest vertices from each route and insert the rest of the vertices. In the satellite-adjustment process, a dynamic adjustment for satellites scheme is proposed to adjust the state of satellites. The two schemes aim to construct Hamiltonian circuits with few intersections. Experiments have been conducted on 207 instances to demonstrate the effect of the proposed algorithm on solving 2E-VRP. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more solutions of 2E-VRP with significantly smaller objective-function values. Furthermore, the number of intersections in routes generated by the proposed algorithm is much less than those obtained by the compared algorithms.

In order to tackle this problem, a new agent-based metaheuristic architecture is proposed to capture the uniqueness of vehicles by modelling them as agents while governing the search with centralised agent cooperation. This cooperation aims to generate near optimum routes by minimising the number of vehicles used, total travelled distance, and total waiting times. The innovative architecture encapsulates three individual core modules in a flexible metaheuristic implementation. First, the problem is modelled by an agent-based module that includes its components in representing, evaluating, and altering solutions. A second metaheuristic module is then designed and integrated, followed by a multi-objective module introduced to sort solutions generated by the metaheuristic module based on Pareto dominance. Tests on benchmark instances were run, resulting in better waiting times, with an average reduction of 2.21-time units, at the expense of the other objectives. Benchmark instances are modified to tackle the unique vehicle's problem by randomising locations, capacities, and operating shifts and tested to justify the proposed model's applicability. © 2022 The Author(s)","Agent-based modelling; Centralised agent cooperation; Metaheuristics; Multi-objective optimisation; Unique vehicles; Vehicle routing problem"

Such service, discussed in this article, specifies that a customer can order from multiple restaurants in a single order and choose for them to be delivered together or separately, whereas the commonly discussed mode only permits placing an order in one restaurant at once. In this service, one crucial issue is how to dispatch these orders to couriers for offline delivery. For this, we propose a new three-stage order dispatch scheme, namely, pseudo-assign first, re-route second, and courier selection last, aiming to deliver the orders in time and balance the couriers’ workload. Due to the dynamism and uncertainty inherently involved in this issue, we also take responsiveness to future demands and robustness into consideration when making the dispatch. Compared with existing approaches, the new one significantly balances the couriers’ workload and, meanwhile, keeps good performance in delay rate, making the decisions more practical. Furthermore, this study analyzes the influence of customers’ preference for order splitting and number of couriers on the efficiency of the distribution system, thereby interesting managerial insights for O2O food delivery are revealed. © 2022 by the authors.

In this problem, trucks and motorcycles have left the depot and served customers. After running out of inventory, at the joint nodes with the trucks, the motorcycles have been reloaded as many as the customers need and finally, returned to the depot. After modeling this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model, a particle swarm optimization algorithm, as well as a hybrid of particle swarm optimization-simulated annealing (PSO-SA) algorithm, is also proposed. The PSO-SA algorithm employs both PSO and SA sequentially and combines the advantages of PSO's good exploration capability and SA's good local search properties. Extensive comparisons have been made to evaluate the performance of the mathematical model and the proposed algorithms using two data groups. The results of small-size instances showed that the outputs of the PSO and PSO-SA algorithms are close to the outputs of the GAMS. Furthermore, these algorithms compared to the ant colony optimization (ACO) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithms in terms of objective function value and runtime have satisfactory results for both data groups. In large-size instances, after tuning the parameters of the hybrid algorithm with the Taguchi method, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the PSO, ACO and VNS algorithms. The results and statistical analysis show that the PSO and VNS algorithms have better performance compared to the PSO-SA and ACO algorithms in terms of solution quality. Also, according to the average runtime, the performance of the algorithm PSO-SA is more efficient than that of other algorithms.

Failed deliveries result in rework which in turn has a large impact on the carriers’ delivery cost. In the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) with time windows, each customer request has only one location and one time window describing where and when shipments need to be delivered. In contrast, we introduce and analyze the vehicle routing problem with delivery options (VRPDO), in which some requests can be shipped to alternative locations with possibly different time windows. Furthermore, customers may prefer some delivery options. The carrier must then select, for each request, one delivery option such that the carriers’ overall cost is minimized and a given service level regarding customer preferences is achieved. Moreover, when delivery options share a common location, e.g., a locker, capacities must be respected when assigning shipments. To solve the VRPDO exactly, we present a new branch-price-and-cut algorithm. The associated pricing subproblem is a shortest-path problem with resource constraints that we solve with a bidirectional labeling algorithm on an auxiliary network.

The fact that the distribution of goods is being affected by multiple factors, stemming from the demands of transportation companies, customers, and the external environment, has made the vehicle routing problem (VRP) among the most studied topics in operational research. These factors are transformed either to constraints or variables of the problem and finally lead to the creation of different variants of the VRP, formulated and studied by researchers. Moreover, the management of logistics and supply chain operations is being enhanced by the use of algorithms, integrated into information systems, enabling the optimization of real-life distribution cases. This paper presents a methodology for classifying the multiple VRP variants related to freight transportation, that most logistics and distribution companies face in their daily operations, as well as the algorithms solving the various problems. The application of the research methodology concluded to 334 papers, which were further sorted to 263 papers on the subject of freight transportation, aiming to identify the trends of the VRP variants and the applied algorithms, during the last decade. The correlation between the VRP variants and the applied algorithms is also identified.

Both internal combustion vehicles (ICV) and alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) are considered, dividing GVRP into two separate subclasses: ICV-based GVRP and AFV-based GVRP. In the ICV-based subclass, the environmental aspect comes from the objective function which aims to minimize GHG emissions or fuel usage of ICVs. On the other hand, the environmental aspect of AFV-based GVRP is implicit and comes from using AFVs in transport. Since GVRP is NP-hard, finding the exact solution in a reasonable amount of time is often impossible for larger instances, which is why metaheuristic approaches are predominantly used. The purpose of this study is to detect gaps in the literature and present suggestions for future research in the field. For that purpose, we review recent papers in which GVRP was tackled by some metaheuristic methods and describe algorithm specifics, VRP attributes, and objectives used in them. © 2023 Faculty of Organizational Sciences, Belgrade.

Firstly, an elementary GVRP model and several fuel consumption/carbon emission measuring methods are briefly described. Secondly, according to the optimization of environmental benefit and the composition of objective function, GVRP models are classified into tree types, i.e. fuel consumption/carbon emission minimization VRP, comprehensive cost minimization VRP and multi-objective VRP. Each model is discussed from four aspects, namely optimization objective, factors influencing fuel consumption/carbon emission, measurement models of fuel consumption/carbon emission and constraints. Then, some solving methods about GVRP such as exact algorithms, heuristic algorithms and metaheuristic algorithms are briefly introduced, and several widely used metaheuristic algorithms are analyzed.

In the recent years, it has increasingly drawn the attention of the researchers because of its potentially significant practical value. The IRP is classified as NP-hard problem since it subsumes the vehicle routing problem (VRP). This fact led to the development of many heuristic or metaheuristic approaches, although a small number of exact methods have been introduced recently. Heuristic methods offer the advantage of shorter time scales, i.e., greater computational efficiency, on the expense of course of the accuracy of the results. The immediate trigger for this study is our concern about results validation, which has been debatable in early papers, and only recently a systematic effort to create a set of optimally solved benchmark instances has been made. This article presents the heuristic methods for solving the basic variants of IRP found in the literature, stressing the computational results and the solution verification approach, rather than the methodology of the algorithms.

The rollout algorithm is part of the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) lookahead solution approach for a Markov Decision Processes (MDP) framed Multi-Depot Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Road Capacity (MDDVRPSRC). First, a Deterministic Multi-Depot VRP with Road Capacity (D-MDVRPRC) is presented. Then an extension, MDVRPSRC-2S, is presented as an offline two-stage SILP model of the MDDVRPSRC. These models are validated using small simulated instances with CPLEX. Next, two reduced versions of the MDVRPSRC-2S model (MDVRPSRC-2S1 and MDVRPSRC-2S2) are derived. They have a specific task in routing: replenishment and delivering supplies. These reduced models are to be utilised interchangeably depending on the capacity of the vehicle, and repeatedly during the execution of rollout in reinforcement learning. As a result, it is shown that a base policy consisting of an exact optimal decision at each decision epoch can be obtained constructively through these reduced two-stage stochastic integer linear programming models. The results obtained from the resulting rollout policy with CPLEX execution during rollout are also presented to validate the reduced model and the matheuristic algorithm.

To the best of our knowledge, no study from the supply chain point of view has been reported to model and address this kind of problem. Thus, this paper is to select the best route that reduces the time elapsed between the workshops and the visit time of the inspectors by using two-tier supply chain simulation coupled with the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to give them more opportunity to visit more workshops. In this study, by considering the number of workshops, the limitation of the number of the existing inspectors and the priority of inspecting the workshops, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented.

One of the major problems of Combinatorial NP-hard Optimization Problem is QAP mathematical model. Consequently, many approaches have been introduced to solve this problem, and these approaches are classified as Approximate and Exact methods. With QAP, each facility is allocated to just one location, thereby reducing cost in terms of aggregate distances weighted by flow values. The primary aim of this study is to propose a hybrid approach which combines Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE) algorithm and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to enhance solutions of QAP model, to reduce the distances between the locations by finding the best distribution of N facilities to N locations, and to implement hybrid approach based on discrete differential evolution (HDDETS) on many instances of QAP from the benchmark. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on several sets of instances from the data set of QAP and the results obtained have shown the effective performance of the proposed algorithm in improving several solutions of QAP in reasonable time. Afterwards, the proposed approach is compared with other recent methods in the literature review. Based on the computation results, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms the other methods. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Algorithm; Combinatorial optimization; Discrete differential evolution; Facility layout problem; Problems; Quadratic assignment problem; Tabu search algorithm"

The study was conducted to find the shortest route that the carrier will take. Effective algorithms are sought to find better solutions. Another study will develop VRP cases to be closer to real conditions. In actual conditions, the VRP cases are very complex. Several solutions that are considered good can be implemented to solve this problem. VRP in shipping bulk products, such as oil, cements, and fertilizers is one of the daily logistical cases carried out in an archipelago country. Bulk products are shipped from the depot port city to other islands. The optimum solution is needed to make the delivery shorter distance and the products can be sent faster. The solution to the VRP case with a single product can no longer solve the problem of bulk product shipment. Bulk product shipment involves more than one product with more than one ship compartment. The number of ship compartments that are smaller than the number of products will further increase the complexity of the VRP of bulk product shipment. The combination of several metaheuristic methods and strategies of product selection to fill undedicated compartment of ship is used to find the shortest route. Modified Nawas Enscore Ham (M-NEH), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and 3-Opt algorithms are combined to solve VRP. This hybrid algorithm called Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) is improved and supports each other. HPSO provides a better solution than those algorithms separately and other metaheuristics namely Tabu Search (TS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The implementation of the algorithm to solve real data of bulk cement transportation supports the conclusion that HPSO is superior to the other algorithms. It has 0.99% more effective than the second best and about 3.42% more effective than the average total distance of five other compared metaheuristic methods. © 2021.

This problem leads to ensure giving specific cares to people in need either in illness or disability in their own homes. Home Health Care (HHC) proposes this kind of services for patients demanding it. These services have to be done at the request of the patient which appears to be the client in a way that gives satisfaction to the requester of the service. Often, these demands are bound by a specific time that the workforce (caregivers) are obligated to respect in addition to the precedence (priority) constraint. The main purpose of the HHC structures is to provide a service that is good in term of quality, minimize the overall costs and shorten the losses. To reduce the costs of these HHC structures, it is mandatory to find comprehensible and logical ways to do it, for it is not permissible to touch the caregiver salary, HHC structures find themselves in the obligation to optimize by other means such as reducing the travel cost. Note that these structures give cares in one's home, which means that the travel aspect is important and is considered the core spending charges of the institution. Another fact is the satisfaction of the patients toward caregivers; this is an essential element to optimize in order to obtain a good quality service, to give a realistic aspect for the problem the lunch break of caregivers is introduced as a parameter. For those arguments, a conception of an efficient planning of caregivers involves using decision tools and optimization methods. A caregiver (vehicle) is attributed to a patient (customer) to do a number of cares with several options in accordance to the customer wishes like time windows requirement often specified by the client, the priority or precedence constraints are usually performed if a care have to be performed before another and could need the intervention of more than one caregiver and must have at least one lunch break a day and it is not always taken at a set time of the day and must be versatile to optimize customer demand satisfaction. To resolve this issue which is called VRPTW-SPLB, a mathematical model of the problem is proposed and explained as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a greedy heuristic based on a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Procedure (GRASP) is proposed, two strategies based on local search and two metaheuristics, and a metaheuristic resultant of an hybridization of the two metaheuristics.

This problem arises in sustainable applications for e-commerce and city distribution. In the first echelon, trucks depart from a single depot and transport goods to two types of locations. At covering locations, such as parcel lockers, customers can pick up goods themselves. At satellite locations, goods are transferred to zero-emission vehicles (such as cargo bikes) that deliver to customers. If desired, customers can indicate their choice for delivery. The 2E-VRP-CO aims at finding cost-minimizing solutions by selecting locations and routes to serve all customers. We present a compact mixed integer programming formulation and an efficient and tailored adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that provides high-quality, and often optimal, solutions to the 2E-VRP-CO. The 2E-VRP-CO has as special cases the two-echelon vehicle routing problem, and the simultaneous facility location and vehicle routing problem without duration constraints. On these special cases, for which our heuristic predominantly solves the established benchmark instances either to optimality or to the best-known solution, our heuristic finds three new best-known solutions. Moreover, we introduce a new set of benchmark instances for the 2E-VRP-CO and provide managerial insights when distribution via both satellite and covering locations is most beneficial. Our results indicate that customers in the same area are best-served either via cargo-bikes or parcel lockers (i.e., not both), and that the use of parcel lockers has a great potential to reduce driving distance. © 2020","Cargo bikes; City logistics; Location routing; Parcel lockers; Sustainable logistics; Two-echelon vehicle routing"

The proposed heuristic is called the Fisher and Jaikumar Algorithm with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (FJA-ALNS algorithm). The objective of this case is to minimize the total distance, while using a minimum number of multi-compartment vehicles. In the first phase, we used the FJA to solve the MCVRP for the fuel delivery problem. The results from solving the FJA were utilized to be the initial solutions in the second phase. In the second phase, a hybrid algorithm, namely the FJA-ALNS algorithm, has been developed to improve the initial solutions of the individual FJA. The results from the FJA-ALNS algorithm are compared with the exact method (LINGO software), individual FJA and individual ALNS. For small-sized problems (N=5), the results of the proposed FJA-ALNS and all methods provided no different results from the global optimal solution, but the proposed FJA-ALNS algorithm required less computational time. For larger-sized problems, LINGO software could not find the optimal solution within the limited period of computational time, while the FJA-ALNS algorithm provided better results with much less computational time. In solving the four numerical examples using the FJA-ALNS algorithm, the result shows that the proposed FJA-ALNS algorithm is effective for solving the MCVRP in this case. Undoubtedly, future work can apply the proposed FJA-ALNS algorithm to other practical cases and other variants of the VRP in real-world situations. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Adaptive Large Neighborhood; Fisher and Jaikumar algorithm; Heuristic; Multi-compartment vehicle; routing problem; Search; Vehicle routing problem"

VRP with time window constraints (VRPTW) restricts that the service time of each customer should start within a time window. This problem and its variations are known to be NP-hard. This paper proposes a transformation of the NP-hard problem into another. The approach is based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) in order to take advantage of its relative CPU time competitiveness. This poses transformability challenges in order to apply SMT solving techniques on the VRPTW. In this work, SMT is successfully applied to solve the VRPTW. The solution quality proves to be competitive to other optimization techniques since the solving time is significantly decreased opening the door to solve much larger problems.

Based on the traveling salesman problem model (traveling salesman problem, TSP) and vehicle routing problem model (vehicle routing problem, VRP), the basic framework of the mathematical models of TSP-D (traveling salesman problem with drone) and VRP-D (vehicle routing problem with drone) was constructed, the network structure and constraints in each model, combined with the characteristics of drone operation was considered. In particular, the possible additional constraints in the case of multi-drones and simultaneous pick-up and delivery were given. Compared with the traditional TSP and VRP models, the network was more complex when drone was integrated into the distribution routing optimization problem. When constructed the VDRP model, in addition to the traditional vehicle routing constraints and vehicle time constraints, the drone routing constraints and drone time constraints should be considered. In particular, it is necessary to increase the cooperative constraints of vehicle and drone in path node and time coordination.

From the literature review, most studies treat such problems as a vehicle routing problem (VRP). In those studies, repair resources are always dispatched as complete crews, and cannot be divided into smaller scales. Furthermore, each disaster point is only allowed one group of resources to recover it, without considering the possibility of accelerating the production rate subjected to specific objectives. Such limitation restricts required resources in an inflexible manner. Therefore, this study defines all repair works as an emergency repair project and adopts the framework of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP), which can resolve such complicated resource assignment issue. A novel emergency repair scheduling model for the road network is proposed based on Constraint Programming (CP) as the searching algorithm to facilitate model formulation. According to the RCPSP concepts, disaster points are set as repair activities and resource travel routes between disaster points are set as transit activities. All the repair activities are linked by transit activities and the required resources are assigned accordingly. In order to consider the second-wave hazard events of where new disaster points may occur, and new resources may be added into emergency repair projects, a rescheduling feature is integrated into the proposed model. Through two case studies, research findings show that this model can be easily modulated to adapt to different situations satisfying practical disaster management goals and solving emergency repair scheduling problems for road networks efficiently. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective is to incorporate new customers into the schedule as they become known while still attempting to minimize the cost of serving all customers without violating the problem constraints. This work proposes an effective population-based approach that integrates various algorithmic components to address DVRP. The approach combines a local search algorithm with various evolutionary operators (crossover and mutation) in an adaptive manner. To promote diversity, the proposed approach utilizes a population of solutions and uses a quality- and-diversity strategy to retain only promising solutions. The well-known 21 DVRP benchmark instances are utilized to test the performance of the proposed approach. An experimental comparison is carried out to assess the contribution of the integrated components. Results demonstrate that the integrated components significantly improve search performance. It is also shown that the proposed approach produces new best results for several instances when compared with the best methods reported in the literature. Note to Practitioners-This work deals with dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRPs). In DVRP, only limited information is available at the start, and new information is revealed over time. It proposes an effective hybrid approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach combines evolutionary operators and a local search approach in an adaptive manner to exploit the benefits of each algorithmic component. The proposed approach produces several new best-known solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective in dealing with DVRP and can help decision-makers in designing best-routing solutions. © 2021 IEEE.","Dynamic optimization; Evolutionary algorithm; Metaheuristic; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

Tremendously compromising road safety, road users may have fatal accidents caused by untimely repair actions. The road maintenance department needs to take the responsibilities for road sections in the form of inspections and faces the decision about how to properly allocate available resources to repair pavement damages immediately. When performing pavement repair works, we need to consider the resource consumption behavior and explore the mechanism of replenishing resources and calculating the return time. Therefore, in order to help maintenance units to deal with consumable resource issues, this study proposes a novel approach to offer the mechanism of consumable resource calculation, which is difficult to solve through the traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) approach. This proposed model treats the pothole repair problem as a resource‐constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), which is capable of resolving such consumable resource considerations. The proposed model was developed by adopting constraint programming (CP) techniques. Research results showed that the proposed model is capable of providing the optimal decisions of pavement pothole repair tasks and also meets practical requirements to make appropriate adjustment, and helps the maintenance unit to shorten total repair duration and optimize resource assignment decisions of pavement maintenance objectives. © 2021 by the authors.

To determine the vehicle routes in a vast distribution area and a large number of retailers that have to be served causes the VRP model to become complicated. Therefore, this paper applies the cluster first-route second concept to design a distribution system in two stages. The first stage is to cluster the distribution area based on the distance between retailers. The second stage is to determine a vehicle route for each cluster using the multi-objective vehicle routing problem with time window and balanced driver workload (VRPTWBW) approach. The proposed VRPTWBW model has three objectives, i.e., (i) to minimize the number of assigned vehicles, (ii) to minimize the total delivery time, and (iii) to balance the driver workload. This second stage starts once the clusters of the distribution area are set. Contrasted with the current practice in the company, this proposed model offers the significant impacts: (i) the reduction of workload gap among driver about 29% (from 2.59 hours to 1.83 hours); (ii) the increased of vehicle utility by 44% (from 30% to 43%), and (iii) the increase savings of two-week course fees of IDR. 11 million (about 23.84%). © 2021 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

As the local markets were shut down, more people started turning to e-commerce logistics platforms offering doorstep deliveries of essential items (food and medicines). This resulted in an explosion in demand for such services, and businesses struggled to complete their deliveries. Additionally, the volume of real-time text data suddenly increased, as these customers started sharing their feedback on social media platforms. The availability of real-time raw text data and its popularity for solving complex business problems motivated the development of the approach proposed herein to address last-mile delivery issues. Thus, this paper suggests the use of Twitter data to identify the various grievances of customers about e-commerce logistics platforms. Natural language processing, a popular tool for text analytics, is employed to extract consumer tweets from the Twitter profiles of such businesses and subsequently to clean, process, and analyse them. Issues are categorized and used as objectives in a multiobjective fuzzy vehicle routing problem (VRP). An integrated hybrid fuzzy VRP is developed and coded to solve last-mile delivery issues.

The mobile depots offer the possibility of keeping the task vehicles operational by supplying them en route with certain resources. For example, in two-echelon distribution systems, small task vehicles are used to navigate narrow streets and to deliver/collect goods or to collect waste, and larger vehicles serve as mobile depots to replenish the goods to be delivered or to receive collected goods or waste at the outskirts of the urban area. Accessibility constraints may also be imposed by regulations on emissions, which make some areas only accessible for environmentally friendly vehicles such as, for example, battery-powered electric vehicles. Especially if the respective refueling infrastructure is sparse, mobile refueling stations seem to be an interesting alternative. In this paper, we introduce the vehicle-routing problem with time windows and mobile depots (VRPTWMD) to capture the routing decisions of the described applications in a generalized fashion. The VRPTWMD is characterized by fleets of task vehicles (TVs) and support vehicles (SVs). The SVs may serve as mobile depots to restore either the load or the fuel capacity of the TVs that are used to fulfill the customer requests. We present a mixed-integer program for the VRPTWMD with which small instances can be solved using a commercial solver. Moreover, we develop a high-quality hybrid heuristic composed of an adaptive large neighborhood search and a path relinking approach to provide solutions on larger problem instances. We use a newly generated set of large VRPTWMD instances to analyze the effect of different problem characteristics on the structure of the identified solutions. In addition, our approach shows very convincing performance on benchmark instances for the related two-echelon multiple-trip VRP with satellite synchronization, which can be viewed as a special case of the VRPTWMD. Our heuristic is able to significantly improve a large part of the previous best-known solutions while spending notably less computation time than the comparison algorithm from the literature.

Delayed latency corresponds to caregivers' total overtime hours worked while visiting patients. A new mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to address this problem. Computational experiments, with more than 165 new benchmark instances, are carried out using the CPLEX and Gurobi MIP solvers.

Considering the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), one of the effective strategies to control greenhouse gas emissions is to convert the fossil fuel-powered fleet into Environmentally Friendly Vehicles (EFVs). Given the multitude of constraints and assumptions defined for different types of VRPs, as well as assumptions and operational constraints specific to each type of EFV, many variants of environmentally friendly VRPs (EF-VRP) have been introduced. In this paper, studies conducted on the subject of EF-VRP are reviewed, considering all the road transport EFV types and problem variants, and classifying and discussing with a single holistic vision. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it determines a classification of EF-VRP studies based on different types of EFVs, i.e., Alternative-Fuel Vehicles (AFVs), Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid Vehicles (HVs). Second, it presents a comprehensive survey by considering each variant of the classification, technical constraints and solution methods arising in the literature.

In this paper, a bi-objective vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (BO-VRPSD) was investigated, which aims to minimize total cost and customer dissatisfaction. Different from traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) models, both the uncertainty in customer demands and the nature of multiple objectives make the problem more challenging. To cope with BO-VRPSD, a membrane-inspired multi-objective algorithm (MIMOA) was proposed, which is characterized by a parallel distributed framework with two operation subsystems and one control subsystem, respectively. In particular, the operation subsystems leverage a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with clustering strategy to reduce the chance of inferior solutions. Meanwhile, the control subsystem exploits a guiding strategy as the communication rule to adjust the searching directions of the operation subsystems. Experimental results based on the ten 120-node instances with real geographic locations in Beijing show that, MIMOA is more superior in solving BO-VRPSD to other classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering strategy; Membrane-inspired algorithm; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Stochastic demand; Vehicle routing problem"

In this paper, the CVRP with backhauls from multiple depots is addressed from the low carbon perspective. The problem calls for the minimization of the carbon emissions of a fleet of vehicles needed for the delivery of the items demanded by the clients.

The 2E-VRP-SBS involves the inter-satellite linehaul on the first echelon, and the pickups from senders to origin satellites (i.e., satellites for cargo collection) and deliveries from destination satellites (i.e., satellites for cargo deliveries) to receivers on the second echelon.

This is due essentially to its many real applications in logistics for the transport of goods. The originality and contribution of our work is that we have dealt a problem that combines several variants: multiple vehicles (m), multiple depots (MD), pickup and delivery problem (PDP) with time windows (TW). Hence the notation of our problem: m-MDPDPTW. In this paper, we present the m-MDPDPTW, which is an optimisation problem belonging to the category of NP Hard problems. This problem must meet requests for transport between customers and suppliers satisfying precedence, capacity and time constraints. The goal is to find the best solution, which is the best route minimising the total travelled distance. To solve and optimise our m-MDPDPTW, we have developed a new algorithm based on the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method.

Moreover, as collaborations in logistics between several companies become popular, more flexible and extended models must be solved to consider the different needs of the companies. This is of high importance in a new logistics concept, the Physical Internet, which is expected to considerably improve the way logistics are handled in the current supply chain management. To optimise the aforementioned requirements, a rich vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery including numerous attributes is modelled and solved. A mathematical formulation is proposed and implemented in CPLEX to solve the problem. Given the complexity of the problem, solving large instances with exact methods is very time-consuming. Therefore, a multi-threaded meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing is developed. A set of new operators coupled with a restart strategy and memory are developed to help improve the performance. Computational results on a generated data-set showed that the proposed meta-heuristic is superior to the CPLEX solver in terms of solvability and computational time.

In order to effectively solve dynamic VRP (DVRP), many optimization strategies have been introduced in the literature. A new variant of vehicle routing problem is proposed which combines DVRP with time windows and capacity constraints, named capacitated DVRP with time windows (CDVRPTW). Apart from the traditional way of handling the problem, this paper proposes a novel strategy that incorporates improved firefly algorithm (IFA) into the framework of spiking neural P (SN P) systems, named spiking neural firefly optimization (SFO). A mathematical model of the problem is formulated, and the solution scheme is designed by associating a number of SN P systems that work in parallel to find optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Additionally, the parameters in the IFA are optimized by adjusting the rule probabilities using SN P systems.

This means generating appropriate routes, according to the classic problem called Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Method: The information of more than 200 clients is analyzed for its realization. Quality tools, such as Pareto analysis and process approach, were combined with optimization techniques based on the ClarkeWright method and the use of time windows through the VRP Solver 3.0 program. Results: With the design of the routes proposed to meet the deliveries of one of the areas with the highest demand in the company (Central Zone), the results of the simulation showed an increase in the service level of 60 %, given the use of the vehicle to the distribution in a complete working day and not only in half day of work. It is evident that the increase in customers served generates additional income, sufficient to cover the costs of using the vehicle half working day more, with profits for the company. Likewise, the delivery capacity, in Tm, is increased by 39 %. So the accumulated merchandise by delivery is eliminated. Conclusions: With the use of time windows, a method for route programming is proposed by applying the VRP Solver 3.0 tool, more consistent with the daily operation of logistics operators as the case studied. Likewise, this article constitutes a way of bringing the theoretical knowledge of the academy to the efficient management of the service in SMEs. Thus, companies like the case presented, can further improve their service level with appropriate technologies for the processing and control of customer information, with the purpose to planning the deliveries. © 2020, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas.

This study integrates the Fuel Consumption Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Two-Dimensional Loading Constraints (2L-FHFVRP). To reduce fuel consumption taking the associated environmental impact into account is a classical VRP variant that has gained increasing attention in the last decade. The objective of this problem is to design the delivery routes to satisfy the customers’ demands with the lowest possible fuel consumption, which depends on the distances of the paths, the assigned vehicles, the loading/unloading pattern and the load weight. In the vehicle routing problem literature, the approximate algorithms have had great success, especially the evolutionary ones, which appear in previous works with quite a sophisticated structure, obtaining excellent results, but that are difficult to implement and adapt to other variants such as the one proposed here. In this study, we present a specialized genetic algorithm to solve the design of routes, keeping its main characteristic: the easy implementation. By contrast, the loading of goods restriction is validated by means of a GRASP algorithm, which has been widely employed for solving packing problems. With a view of confirming the performance of the proposed methodology, we provide a computational study that uses all the available benchmark instances, allowing to illustrate the savings achieved in fuel consumption. In addition, the methodology suggested can be adapted to the version of solely minimizing the total distance traveled for serving the customers (without the fuel consumption) and it is compared to the best works presented in the literature. The computational results show that the methodology manages to be adequately adapted to this version and it is capable of finding improved solutions for some benchmark instances. As for future work, we propose to adjust the methodology to consider the three-dimensional loading problem so that it adapts to more reallife conditions of the industry. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","2L-FHFVRP; 2L-HFVRP; Elitist Genetic Algorithm; GRASP; Sequential Loading"

This paper studies the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for the first-mile transportation, which aims at finding the optimal travel routes for a vehicle fleet to deliver passengers from their doorstep to the depots, where the passengers can continue their journeys using fixed-route buses or trains. We focus on the Peak-Hour VRP (PHVRP) for a limited vehicle fleet capacity to serve a large volume of travel requests, with the aim of maximizing the number of served passengers. The PHVRP generalizes the VRP with time window by considering multiple alternative depots for each travel request, such that a request is satisfied if the passenger is taken to one of his/her nearest depots. We formally formulate the PHVRP with constraints on vehicle capacity, pickup time windows, and quality of service regarding riding time, where a novel trip-based constraint model is used. We proposed an ant-colony optimization algorithm for the PHVRP, which is initialized with pheromone information that jointly considers the temporal-spatial distance as well as depot similarity among different travel requests. We introduced a novel scheme (called trip-by-trip scheme) to construct the travel routes by repeatedly forming a single trip for the vehicle with earliest end time until no vehicle can accept any more trips. In constructing a single trip, the algorithm intelligently decides whether or not to end the trip instead of taking more passengers. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated by comparing with optimal solutions on small size instances and with heuristic solutions on large-size instances, using road network in Singapore and synthetic travel requests that are generated based on real bus travel demands.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.","alternative depot; First-mile problem; peak-hour VRP; trip-based constraint model; trip-by-trip routing scheme"

However, several scheduling problems arise in HC, and the providers must make several scheduling and routing decisions, e.g., the assignment of caregivers to clients, in order to balance operating costs and client satisfaction. Starting from the analysis of a real HC provider operating in New York City, NY, USA, this article addresses a scheduling problem with chargeable overtime and preference matching and formulates it as an integer programming model. The objective is to minimize a cost function that includes traveling costs, the overtime cost paid by the provider, the preference mismatch, and a penalty related to the continuity of care violation. To solve this problem, we design a matheuristic algorithm that integrates a specific variable neighborhood search with a set covering model. The results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our approach to solving real-size instances. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to discuss practical insights. Note to Practitioners - This article provides a decision support tool to HC managers, which appropriately assigns caregivers to clients and makes routing decisions over a long horizon. Chargeable overtimes and preference matching enclosed in this tool are rarely considered in the literature, despite matching is relevant in HC caregiver-to-client assignments and chargeable overtime has potential in tailoring the service level based on the specific client. We formulate the scheduling problem as a mathematical model. Then, we propose a matheuristic algorithm to efficiently solve the problem in real-size instances. The results show the applicability and efficiency of our method. Thus, HC managers can exploit it to efficiently make assignment and routing decisions and to analyze the impact on other operating costs when adjusting any of them. © 2020 IEEE.","Home care (HC) assignment and scheduling; set covering model (SCM); variable neighborhood search (VNS); vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

We developed a hybrid of three strategies—a modified ant system, a sweep algorithm, and a path relinking—for solving a capacitated vehicle routing optimization problem, a vehicle routing problem with a capacity constraint. A sweep algorithm was used to generate initial solutions and assign customers to vehicles, followed by a modified ant system to generate new generations of good solutions. Path relinking was used for building a better solution (candidate) from a pair of guiding and initial solutions.

Optimized route and simultaneous pickup and delivery in a vehicle routing problem (VRP) can achieve the same. This paper investigates a two-echelon pollution routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery by considering multiple time windows (2E-PRPSPD-MTW) for customers’ visit. The first echelon consists of depots and intermediate depots (called satellites), whereas the second echelon consists of the satellites and customers. Two fleets (one for each echelon) of heterogeneous vehicles accomplish pickup and delivery operations. The 2E-PRPSPD-MTW is developed in a bi-objective framework, focusing on minimization of both travel time and fuel consumption. The proposed bi-objective 2E-PRPSPD-MTW is an NP-hard problem. So, in order to optimize it, multi-objective variable neighborhood search (MOVNS) is modified and used. In this process, six operators are proposed in order to improve the neighborhood structure.

A new model for SNPS has been recommended both for finding the optimal solutions and for optimizing the parameters that are used in the calculation of minimum feasible insertion cost of the customer insertion phase of VRP without using any heuristic operators. The SNPS suggested here is an adaptive SNPS in which some potentials (ATSNPS) with learning and training facilities are incorporated.

This has led to growth in both the formulation of multiobjective models and exact and approximate solution techniques. In this article, to verify the quality of the results, first, a mathematical model is proposed that takes into account both economic and work balance objectives simultaneously and is solved using an exact method based on the decomposition approach.

The HVRPTW-LR arises when a limited number of resources, such as vehicles, drivers, instruments, and so on, are available but are insufficient to serve all customers in a route planning. Therefore, the route design involves the selection of customers to be visited at each route and resources to be used. Applications to this problem are found in real services companies with high seasonal demand which attend to different types of works and have to decide on how to effectively manage their resources. For designing optimal routes, a hierarchical objective function is considered, maximizing the total number of served customers as the primary objective, and minimizing the travel costs as secondary. A mathematical model of linear programming is introduced to describe and understand all constraints clearly. The problem is first heuristically solved by a semi-parallel insertion heuristic. Then, solutions are improved by a hybrid variable neighborhood descent metaheuristic based on a Tabu Search algorithm for the exploration of the neighborhood and a holding list.

In contrast, most research on VRP has been based on classic test cases which are relatively small and have standard objectives. By investigating the case of a real urban security carrier in China, this paper proposes an efficient variable neighbourhood search (VNS) for large-scale VRP with various objectives and constraints, including number of vehicles, total travel time, total travel distance, total waiting time and total late time. The method is used to explore the tradeoffs among different objectives and constraints. It is found that although these objectives and constraints are contradictory by nature, increasing the weighting factor of one does not necessarily undermine (or at least not significantly undermine) the others. Such dynamics in the tradeoffs among different objectives provides users with more flexibility.

These will provide optimal as well as autonomous navigation capability which is built entirely upon field coverage plan thereby making robot navigation approach a paramount scheme. In this paper, the autonomy of an agricultural mobile robot is enhanced in a structured environment (greenhouse farm) to locate an optimum route such that the robot performs a selective and variable spray of pesticides to the plants. To realize this, a robust vehicle routing problem (VRP) scheme is designed to navigate the robot autonomously while making intelligent decisions to fulfil the pesticide demands at each node (infected plants). The improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) is adopted to solve this fully integer problem based on three (3) test cases carried out with 8, 32 and 56 infected plants respectively for validation. The results obtained show a trade-off solution as the Optimal INSGA-III is significantly lower than NSGA-III in terms of solution quality.

Investigation indicates relationships between school-Trip commutes, i.e., students' trips to and from school, and traffic congestion. Therefore, optimizing traffic in terms of the school-Trip commute is considered as an important practice of smart cities. This article proposes a long-coding adapted genetic algorithm for large-scale school district replanning. Moreover, the fitness function takes into account both the congestion coefficient model and the grayscale difference model, which can reduce the traffic congestion as well as balance the traffic load on school-Trip routes. Based on the above results, the school-Trip route optimization is formulated as the school bus routing problem (SBRP) and the split demand school bus routing problem (SDSBRP). A max-min ant system with a pheromone smoothing mechanism is proposed for the SBRP and the SDSBRP. Considering the large scale of the problem, a high-compactness K-means algorithm is proposed to determine bus stops before school bus routing. Besides, a public bus allocation strategy is proposed to allocate a fleet of public buses to serve school-Trip routes with low allocation costs. The proposed algorithms are tested on a realistic and challenging dataset from real world.

Based on these assumptions, we proposed to extend the route division procedure proposed by Kuo and Wang [4] such that when one of the restrictions can not be met, the routing division continues to create a new sub-route to find an acceptable solution. To solve the formulated problem, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the vehicle routing plan.

In particular, local search-based metaheuristics have been successfully applied to the capacitated VRP (CVRP). The CVRP aims at defining the minimum-cost delivery routes for a given set of identical vehicles since each vehicle only travels one route and there is a single (central) depot. The best metaheuristics to the CVRP avoid getting stuck in local optima by embedding specific hill-climbing mechanisms such as diversification strategies into the solution methods. This paper introduces a hybridization of a novel adaptive version of Iterated Local Search with Path-Relinking (AILS-PR) to the CVRP.

Inner-city center deliveries are performed by small vehicles due to access restrictions, while deliveries outside this area are carried out by conventional vehicles for economic reasons. Goods are transferred from the first to the second echelon by synchronized meetings between vehicles of the respective echelons. We investigate the assignment of customers to vehicles, i.e., to the first or second echelon, within a so-called ‘grey zone’ on the border of the inner city and the area around it. While doing this, the economic objective as well as negative external effects of transport, such as emissions and disturbance (negative impact on citizens due to noise and congestion), are taken into account to include objectives of companies as well as of citizens and municipal authorities. Our metaheuristic – a large neighborhood search embedded in a heuristic rectangle/cuboid splitting – addresses this problem efficiently. We investigate the impact of the free assignment of part of the customers (‘grey zone’) to echelons and of three different city layouts on the solution. Computational results show that the impact of a ‘grey zone’ and thus the assignment of these customers to echelons depend significantly on the layout of a city.

A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to produce efficient solutions. Since traditional methods are incapable of computing the expected values of such fuzzy variables, the technique of fuzzy simulation is incorporated in the GA. Five alternative fuel vehicles - electric, hybrid, diesel, biodiesel, and CNG, are evaluated vis-a-vis multiple criteria using fuzzy hierarchical technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and their respective scores are input in the hybrid GA for sustainable, apt, and low-cost assignment of vehicles to routes. The algorithm is run for multiple combinations of crossover and mutation probabilities, vehicle capacities, location instances, and number of generations. The experimental results substantiate the robustness of the proposed approach and suffice to project the strength of the computationally challenging model. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Fuzzy hierarchical technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS); fuzzy simulation; genetic algorithm; vehicle routing; vehicle selection"

To solve this situation in this paper are considered two sub-models. The first sub-model uses vehicle routing problem (VRP) for routing fleet among generation waste to separation facilities. The second sub-model is designed to allocate resources from separation facilities to set of recovery plants or landfill centers. From the best of our knowledge, most of the past studies related to this topic have focused only on deterministic implementations. Also, recent studies usually focus on uncertain parameters in the area of waste generation. In addition, a few related studies have developed the uncertain parameter which has focused on facilitating separation. This study considers the uncertain parameters in the output rate of separation facilities as well as the importance of value recovery from each bin; the aim is to enhance the efficiency of operations. The purpose of this study is to minimize the total transportation cost and to maximize recycled revenue. Chance-constrained programming has been used to deal with stochastic optimization model. Four metaheuristic algorithms are employed to identify the best solution. Besides, the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated.

In this paper, we show that the JOBPRP can be modelled as a clustered vehicle routing problem (CluVRP), a variant of the capacitated VRP in which customers are grouped into clusters. To solve this cluster-based model of the JOBPRP, we apply a two-level variable neighborhood search (2level-VNS) metaheuristic, previously developed for the CluVRP, and study which adaptations are required to perform efficiently in a warehouse environment. Additionally, we evaluate if the Hausdorff distance used as an approximation for the clusters’ proximity in the CluVRP, performs equally well when determining closeness between pick orders in a warehouse. We compare the performance of the Hausdorff-based batching criterion to the cumulative minimal aisles visited-criterion, known as a well-performing batching metric in rectangular warehouses with parallel aisles. The 2level-VNS performs well compared to state-of-the-art algorithms specifically developed for the order batching problem (OBP) in a single-block warehouse. A multi-start VNS remains slightly superior to our approach.

The E-PCVRP is a selective routing problem that focuses on the maximization of the aggregated prize values collected from the visited nodes while minimizing the fixed and variable cost of the formed routes. In terms of variable cost, the CO2 emissions of the vehicles performing the routes are considered as a load-distance function. The presented solution approach is based on the Firefly Algorithm (FA). The FA is an optimization algorithm, designed for the solution of continuous problems, while the proposed E-PCVRP, requires a discrete solution approach. Addressing the above discrepancy, the Firefly Algorithm based on Coordinates (FAC) is introduced, which incorporates the proposed “Coordinates Related” (CR) encoding/decoding process in the original FA scheme. The CR is a novel process that allows for algorithms designed for continuous optimization to by employed in the solution of discrete problems, such as the VRP. Specifically, the CR utilizes auxiliary vectors for solution representation, containing the Cartesian coordinates of each node, that allows for the original movement equation of the FA to be applied directly. The effectiveness of the FAC algorithm is showed over computational experiments and statistical analysis, in comparison to the performance of other bio-inspired algorithms and a mathematical solver. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coordinates related encoding/decoding process; Environmental vehicle routing problem; Firefly algorithm; Prize-collecting vehicle routing problem"

The first paper was published in 1959, and later, many vehicle routing problem variants appeared to simulate real logistical systems. Since vehicle routing problem is an NP-difficult task, the problem can be solved by approximation algorithms. Metaheuristics give a “good” result within an “acceptable” time. When developing a new metaheuristic algorithm, researchers usually use only their intuition and test results to verify the efficiency of the algorithm, comparing it to the efficiency of other algorithms. However, it may also be necessary to analyze the search operators of the algorithms for deeper investigation. The fitness landscape is a tool for that purpose, describing the possible states of the search space, the neighborhood operator, and the fitness function. The goal of fitness landscape analysis is to measure the complexity and efficiency of the applicable operators. The paper aims to investigate the fitness landscape of a complex vehicle routing problem. The efficiency of the following operators is investigated: 2-opt, order crossover, partially matched crossover, cycle crossover. The results show that the most efficient one is the 2-opt operator. Based on the results of fitness landscape analysis, we propose a novel traveling salesman problem genetic algorithm optimization variant where the edges are the elementary units having a fitness value. The optimal route is constructed from the edges having good fitness value. The fitness value of an edge depends on the quality of the container routes. Based on the performed comparison tests, the proposed method significantly dominates many other optimization approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

Various variants of the VRP problem have been presented and discussed in the literature for many years. In most cases, batch versions of the problem are considered, wherein the complete data, including customers’ geographical distribution, is well known. In real-life situations, the data change dynamically, which influences the decisions made by optimization systems. The article focuses on the aspect of geopositioning updates and their impact on the effectiveness of optimization algorithms. Such updates affect the distance matrix, one of the critical datasets used to optimize the VRP problem. A demonstration version of the optimization system was developed, wherein updates are carried out in integration with both open source routing machine and GPS tracking services. In the case of a dynamically changing list of destinations, continuous and effective updates are required. Firstly, temporary values of the distance matrix based on the correction of the quasi-Euclidean distance were generated. Next, the impact of update progress on the proposed optimization algorithms was investigated. The simulation results were compared with the results obtained “manually” by experienced planners. It was found that the upload level of the distance matrix influences the optimization effectiveness in a non-deterministic way. It was concluded that updating data should start from the smallest values in the distance matrix. © 2021 by the authors.

The HVRPSPD may broadly be defined as identifying the minimum cost routes and vehicle types. To solve the HVRPSPD, first, we propose a polynomial-size mixed integer programming formulation. Because the HVRPSPD is an NP-hard problem, it is difficult to determine the optimal solution in a reasonable time for moderate and large-size problem instances. Hence, we develop a hybrid metaheuristic approach based on the simulated annealing and local search algorithms called SA-LS. We conduct a computational study in three stages. First, the performance of the mathematical model and SA-LS are investigated on small and medium-size HVRPSPD instances. Second, we compare SA-LS with the constructive heuristics, nearest neighborhood and Clarke-Wright savings algorithms, adapted for the HVRPSPD. Finally, the performance of SA-LS is evaluated on the instances of the heterogeneous VRP (HVRP), which is a special case of the HVRPSPD. Computational results demonstrate that the mathematical model can solve small-size instances optimally up to 35 nodes; SA-LS provides good quality solutions for medium and large-size problems. Moreover, SA-LS is superior to simple constructive heuristics and can be a preferable solution method to solve HVRP and VRP-SPD instances successfully. © 2021.

In this study, a linear programming (LP) model has been developed for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) in order to minimize the total idle time (MIT). This problem was realized while managing the route operations of a company transporting long-distance passengers by bus in Turkey. The differences between this problem and other VRPs first arise from its objective function. It suggests that vehicles should work more because they make profit if they work. So, its objective function should be defined so as to minimize the sum of the idle time of those vehicles. Contrary to the VR problems examined so far, vehicles should work more, sometimes preferring long-distance routes as well. The other two differences pertain to constraints: Some locations should be visited more than once in different time periods, and subtours could be allowed in some situations. In order to present the problem, a total of 34 routes of the company which belongs to one of the five subgroups were chosen for the samples. To solve this kind of problems, it is very important that exact methods, such as linear programming or branch and bound, should be used. © 2020 Regional Association for Security and crisis management.

The authors aimed to achieve high-performance solutions by coding a manually solved industrial problem and thus solving a real-life vehicle routing problem using Julia language and simulated annealing algorithm. Design / Methodology / Approach: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) that is a widely studied combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem, aims to design optimal tours for a fleet of vehicles serving a given set of customers at different locations. The simulated annealing algorithm is used for periodic capacitated vehicle routing problem. Julia is a state-of-art scientific computation language. Therefore, a Julia programming language toolbox developed for logistic optimization is used. Results: The results are compared to savings algorithms from Matlab in terms of solution quality and time. It is seen that the simulated annealing algorithm with Julia gives better solution quality in reasonable simulation time compared to the constructive savings algorithm. Limitations of the investigation: The data of the company is obtained from 12 periods with a history of four years. About the capacitated vehicle routing problem, the homogenous fleet with 3000 meters/vehicle is used. Then, the simulated annealing design parameters are chosen rule-of-thumb. Therefore, better performance can be obtained by optimizing the simulated annealing parameters. Practical implications: In this study, a furniture roving parts manufacturing company that have 30 customers in Denizli, an industrial city in the west part of Turkey, is investigated. Before the scheduling implementation with Julia, the company has no effective and efficient planning as they have been using spreadsheet programs for vehicle scheduling solutions. In this study, the solutions with Julia are used in practice for the distribution with higher utilization rate and minimum number of vehicles. The simulated annealing and savings algorithms are compared in terms of solution time and performance. The savings algorithm has produced better solution time, the simulated annealing approach has minimum total distance objective value, minimum number of required vehicles, and maximum vehicle utilization rate for the whole model. Thus, this paper can contribute to small scale business management in the sense of presenting a digitalization solution for the vehicle scheduling solution. Also, Julia application of simulated annealing for vehicle scheduling is demonstrated that can help both academicians and practitioners in organizations, mainly in logistics and distribution problems. Originality / Value: The main contribution of this study is a new solution method to capacitated vehicle routing problems for a real-life industrial problem using the advantages of the high-level computing language Julia and a meta-heuristic algorithm, the simulated annealing method. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

In the case of a dependent delivery, at a given point (customer or depot) the drone takes off from a vehicle to serve a customer and then return to travel with the same vehicle, as long as the capacity and endurance constraints for a drone are satisfied. In the other case, each type of vehicle travels independently to others. A MILP model is presented to describe the problem, and then we confirm the formulation via a CPLEX software with small instances. We propose a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the VRPD. Experiments are carried out on the instances taken from the literature in different settings. The results show the performance of the proposed algorithm to solve this variant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drone delivery; Genetic-sweep algorithm; Mathematical model; Vehicle routing problem"

Specifically, we are given a logistic network where nodes correspond to customers, and where each customer requires a set of (partially ordered) operations. A set of technicians is available to perform such operations, and each technician is qualified to execute only a subset of them, depending on his skill. By referring to a specific context such as Health Care, customers are patients while technicians are caregivers. In a Field Service context, instead, customers are usually referred to as clients while technicians as field technicians. The innovative aspect is that some operations may require a special device, which must be transported at the customer site and must be present at the customer location together with a technician qualified to use it. Given technician dependent traveling costs, we address the problem of defining the tours for the technicians and for the special device, while respecting the skill compatibility between customers and technicians, and the time windows, precedence and synchronization constraints. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the generalized Skill VRP, and present some lower bounding techniques based on the proposed formulation. Preliminary computational experiments show that some lower bounding techniques may rapidly produce good lower bounds, thanks to quite effective valid inequalities. The returned percentage optimality gaps, estimated also thanks to a simple matheuristic, are in fact quite small for several scenarios of medium to large size, by encouraging the use of the proposed lower bounding techniques both as building blocks for designing exact approaches, and also as valuable tools to evaluate the efficacy of more sophisticated heuristic approaches to the problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Lower bounding techniques; MILP model; Precedence; Skill VRP; Special device; Synchronization"

According to the original PCVRP formulation, the scope of the problem is to maximize the total collected prize from the visited nodes and simultaneously minimize the fixed vehicle-utilization cost and the variable cost. In the E-PCVRP formulation, the variable cost is not solely expressed as a vehicle-covered distance but as a load-distance function for CO2 emissions minimization. The Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is selected as the solution approach. However, TLBO is designed to address continuous optimization problems, while the solution of the E-PCVRP requires a discrete-numbered representation. Thus, a heuristic encoding/decoding technique is proposed to map the solution in a continuous domain, i.e., the Cartesian space, and transform it back to the original form after applying the learning mechanisms, utilizing the Euclidean Distance. The encoding/decoding process is denoted as CRE, and it has been incorporated into the standard TLBO algorithmic scheme, and as such, the proposed TLBO-CRE algorithmic solution approach emerges.

Therefore, this paper investigates a real-world electric vehicle routing problem (VRP) raised by a logistics company.

Equity concerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the utilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported in the literature. However, there has been only limited discussion about how workload equity should be modeled in the context of VRPs, and various measures for optimizing such objectives have been proposed and implemented without a critical evaluation of their respective merits and consequences. This article addresses this gap by providing an analysis of classical and alternative equity functions for biobjective VRP models. In our survey, we review and categorize the existing literature on equitable VRPs. In the analysis, we identify a set of axiomatic properties that an ideal equity measure should satisfy, collect six common measures of equity, and point out important connections between their properties and the properties of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions. To gauge the extent of these implications, we also conduct a numerical study on small biobjective VRP instances solvable to optimality. Our study reveals two undesirable consequences when optimizing equity with nonmonotonic functions: Pareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all tours are TSP optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be workload inconsistent, i.e., composed of tours whose workloads are all equal to or longer than those of other Pareto-optimal solutions.We show that the extent of these phenomena should not be underestimated. The results of our biobjective analysis remain valid also for weighted sum, constraint-based, or single-objective models. Based on this analysis, we conclude that monotonic equity functions are more appropriate for certain types of VRP models, and suggest promising avenues for further research on equity in logistics. © 2017 INFORMS.","Balancing; Biobjective vehicle routing; Equity measures; Logistics; Workload distribution"

The route balance is frequently considered in a vehicle routing problem (VRP) for balancing the distance travelled among delivery vehicles. This is a common practice since in VRPs there are no time elements. However, in recent years, some research works have considered route balance in a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). As there are more time elements in VRPTW, this paper refutes that route balance is sufficient for VRPTW by simultaneously optimising makespan and workload imbalance using ‘total time balance’ instead of route balance. On the other hand, ‘total time balance’ is the difference between the longest total time taken and the shortest total time taken among delivery vehicles. As such, makespan is the longest total time taken among vehicles. Total time taken for a vehicle is the sum of vehicle run time, waiting time and service time. In order to demonstrate the importance of using total time balance instead of route balance on VRPTW, three different multi-objective VRPTW models, namely, (1) only with general VRPTW objectives (i.e. ‘total distance travelled’ by all vehicles and ‘total number of vehicles’ used), (2) general VRPTW objectives with route balance and (3) general VRPTW objectives with total time balance are developed and solved by fitness aggregated genetic algorithm (FAGA) for 36 Solomon’s benchmark instances. By comparison of the makespan produced by the FAGA between the three cases, the importance of using total time balance instead of route balance on multi-objective VRPTW is demonstrated. Also, the makespan produced by the FAGA for the third case, i.e. general VRPTW objectives with total time balance is compared with the makespan produced by fitness aggregated differential evolution (FADE). By comparing makespan with statistical testing between FAGA and FADE, the outperformance of FAGA over FADE is verified. To check the practicality of the total time balance on multi-objective VRPTW, an instance with real time windows is also solved for the three cases by the FAGA and its makespan are compared and reported. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Differential evolution; Genetic algorithm; Makespan; Route balance; Time balance; Time windows; Vehicle routing problem"

Compared with the traditional Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the PHEV routing problem should consider more constraints, such as time limits, capacity constraints (including fuel tank capacity and battery capacity), electric stations, fuel stations and so forth.

Often, it is necessary to consider stochastic travel times due to traffic conditions or customers availability. However, there is a lack of works discussing stochastic versions of the 2L-VRP. This paper offers a model of the 2L-VRP with stochastic travel times that also includes penalty costs generated by overtime. To solve this stochastic and non-smooth version of the 2L-VRP, a hybrid simheuristic algorithm is proposed.

This problem calls for the minimization of the transportation distance required for the delivery of the items which are demanded by the clients, carried out by a fleet of electric vehicles in several depots. Since the 2L-MDEVRP is an NP-hard problem, a heuristic algorithm combined variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS) and space saving heuristic algorithm (SSH) is proposed. The VNS algorithm is used to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP) sub-problem, and the SSH algorithm is used to solve the bin packing problem (BPP) sub-problem.

This routing problem variant for networks with two echelons has not yet attracted enough research interest. Localized or long-distance services suffer from the lack of the assignment decisions between satellites and customers. Therefore, the 2E-TVRP, rather than using assignment decisions, adopts time constraints to decide the routes on each of the two interacting echelons: large-capacity vehicles transport cargoes among satellites on the first echelon, and small-capacity vehicles deliver cargoes from satellites to customers on the second echelon.

However, mTSP in dynamic circumstances entails a greater complexity that recent approaches are still trying to grasp. Beyond time windows, capacity and other parameters that characterize the dynamics of each scenario, moving targets is one of the underdeveloped issues in the field of mTSP. The approach of this paper harnesses a simple prediction method to prove that integrating forecasting within a metaheuristic evolutionary-based method, such as genetic algorithms, can yield better results in a dynamic scenario than their simple non-predictive version. Real data is used from the retrieval of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) by tuna vessels in the Indian Ocean. Based on historical data registered by the GPS system of the buoys attached to the devices, their trajectory is firstly forecast to feed subsequently the functioning of a genetic algorithm that searches for the optimal route of tuna vessels in terms of total distance traveled.

This paper studies a particular integration of these two problems called the vehicle routing and loading problem (VRLP). The VRLP is an operational problem that must be solved daily by many production and distribution companies. Like the two original problems (VRP and 3D-CLP), the VRLP is NP-hard. In this work, regardless of the complexity of this problem, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that characterizes the VRLP with time windows is presented and it is also used to solve the problem optimally. Then, a model-based heuristic that improves the computational time, when bigger instances need to be solved, is also presented. In order to prove the viability of the approach and the developed MILP model, tests with the benchmark instances of the VRLP were made and the results compared with other published works.

This type of problem originally defined about thirty years ago and still is an open issue. In real life, the OVRP is similar to the delivering newspapers and consignments. The problem of service delivering to a set of customers is a particular open VRP with an identical fleet for transporting vehicles that do not necessarily return to the initial depot. Contractors which are not the employee of the delivery company use their own vehicles and do not return to the depot. Solving the OVRP means to optimize the number of vehicles, the traveling distance and the traveling time of a vehicle. In time, several algorithms such as tabu search, deterministic annealing and neighborhood search were used for solving the OVRP.

Investment-related restrictions in many cases make it impossible to serve some of the potential customers. In such conditions, designing a supply chain network, including a location-allocation problem in the warehouse, Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) at the distribution level, and customer selection at the retail level in several periods of time, is considered. In this respect, in addition to certain methods that can be used in small sizes, metaheuristic algorithms have been used to solve large-scale models.

While the shortest distance goal provides significant advantages in terms of cost and time to businesses, this makes it attractive for further research. When examining the types of problems having different directions and areas devised from different points of view on vehicle routing, it can be said that the closest approach to practical application is the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (VRPSDP). In this study, a solution proposal is presented for the VRPSDP using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the application is tested with the benchmark problem data sets commonly used for VRPSDP in the literature. When the results are compared with the least cost route solutions in the literature, it is observed that despite the few parameters, the proposed method can produce low-cost solutions very close to the most successful solutions in the literature. © 2019 Karabuk University","Artificial Bee Colony algorithm; Optimization; Vehicle routing problem"

A distinctive feature of the presented survey is its focus on new versions of the VRP, which have recently emerged or gained momentum, and the corresponding new solution methods, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence (CI) approaches. The list of newly proposed or currently popular VRP formulations include last mile and same day delivery, crowdshipping, bike sharing systems, post-disaster response plans, local routing in large production or cargo plants, customer-centric VRP, autonomous delivery, unnamed aerial vehicle delivery, green VRP, waste collection VRP, rich VRP, or VRP with backhauls. Simultaneously, an adequate increase of interest in the application of traditional CI methods (e.g., genetic, memetic, ant colony or particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, or their various hybrid versions) can be observed in the VRP domain. At the same time, approaches proven efficient in other optimization areas (e.g., hyperheuristics, methods based on Monte Carlo simulations, algorithms rooted in game theory and bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games, or cognitively motivated methods) have lately entered the VRP field and become a viable alternative to more traditional techniques. Since VRP is one of the fastest growing fields in the operations research area, we believe that an analysis of the recently published VRP papers from the perspective of their novelty in problem formulation and/or applied solution method can provide a true value for the CI community, especially young researchers entering the field and seeking challenges in this interesting and fast developing research area. © 2017 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization; Computational intelligence; metaheuristics; vehicle routing"

This study has focused on VRP and serving customers with several commodity requirements from different geographically scattered suppliers subject to constraints on the vehicle capacity. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to maximize the total profit and the fair sharing of profit among the carriers by considering the travel time minimization is developed. Each carrier with its limited capacity can have reserved requests which must be served by itself and selective requests which can be served by itself or other vehicles or not served at all. There are various applications of the proposed model in the environment which can help reducing number of vehicles serving to the customers and eliminating empty back hauls. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this problem due to its Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) nature. In addition, Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) method is developed for improving the quality of initial solutions. Some instances are generated at different scales to evaluate the algorithm's performance by comparing the results of an exact optimal solution with that of the proposed algorithm.

Moreover, the distribution activities have a non-negligible impact on the environment, as well as on the citizens' welfare. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) aims at designing routes that minimize the cost of serving customers using a given set of capacitated vehicles. Some VRP variants consider traveling times, either in the objective function (e.g., including the goal of minimizing total traveling time or designing balanced routes) or as constraints (e.g., the setting of time windows or a maximum time per route). Typically, the traveling time between two customers or between one customer and the depot is assumed to be both known in advance and static. However, in real life, there are plenty of factors (predictable or not) that may affect these traveling times, e.g., traffic jams, accidents, road works, or even the weather. In this work, we analyze the VRP with dynamic traveling times. Our work assumes not only that these inputs are dynamic in nature, but also that they are a function of the structure of the emerging routing plan. In other words, these traveling times need to be dynamically re-evaluated as the solution is being constructed. In order to solve this dynamic optimization problem, a learnheuristic-based approach is proposed. Our approach integrates statistical learning techniques within a metaheuristic framework. A number of computational experiments are carried out in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness. © 2018 by the authors.","Dynamic traveling times; Learnheuristics; Vehicle routing problem"

Firstly, some strategies are implemented to improve the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm. The tracing radius of the cat group is limited, and the random number parameter r is adaptive adjusted. In addition, a scaling factor update method, called a memory factor y, is introduced into the proposed algorithm. They can be learnt very well so as to jump out of local optimums and speed up the global convergence. Secondly, by comparing the proposed algorithm with PSO, APSO, and CSO, 23 benchmark functions are verified by simulation experiments, which consists of unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension multimodal. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovative hybrid algorithm. Lastly, the proposed ACSO is utilized to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

This has motivated practitioners to include a wide variety of balancing criteria in decision support systems, and researchers to examine the properties of these criteria and the trade-offs made when optimizing them. As a result, previous studies have provided a much-needed understanding of how different equity functions affect the resulting VRP solutions. However, by focusing exclusively on models that balance tour lengths, a critical aspect has thus far remained unexplored — namely the impact of the workload resource subject to the balancing. In this work, we generalize previous studies to different workload resources, extend the scope of those analyses to additional aspects of managerial and methodological significance, and reevaluate accordingly previous conclusions and guidelines for formulating a balance criterion. Overall, our study counter-balances the focus of previous works and reveals the importance of selecting the right workload resource. Although the marginal cost of equity is low for all the examined models, the trade-off structure depends primarily on the workload resource, and less on the equity function. For the same resource, we observe a notable degree of overlap between the solutions found with different equity functions. Moreover, we find that there typically exists a set of low-cost VRP solutions that are well-balanced on average with respect to all the examined balance criteria. However, they are difficult to identify in practice as they are mostly Pareto-dominated by solutions optimized with respect to any single criterion. Finally, we observe that solutions with similar cost and balance tend to exhibit similar solution structure, a property that should be directly exploited by optimization methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Balance; Equity functions; Multi-objective; Vehicle routing; Workload resources"

Due to its NP-hard nature, it is difficult for exact algorithms and heuristics with a linear structure to solve a large-scale problem in a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose a fast decomposition and reconstruction framework (DR) to solve the PDPTWL with high quality in a relatively short time. An angle-based sweep method is used to decompose a complete solution into multiple sub-solutions, each of which is assigned to a tabu search for optimization. To speed up the whole process, the optimization procedure of sub-solutions is performed by different processors of multi-core CPU in parallel. Three neighborhood operators and three strategies to reduce the number of vehicles are designed to cope with the tabu search for further improvement. Moreover, the adaptive memory mechanism is added to provide a better start when the optimization procedure falls into the local optima. We compare our framework against the best known solutions on 119 instances with up to 300 requests, the results show that our framework is able to improve over 85% (107 out of 119) of the best known solutions. More specifically, the number of vehicles is optimized by about 60% (74 out of 119) and the driving distance by about 50% (59 out of 119). In addition on instances with the largest size of requests, the computational time of our framework can be 1/50 of the comparative results, confirming its efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.","adaptive memory; LIFO loading; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; tabu search"

In this work, the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery and time windows is considered. Simultaneous pick-up and delivery (also called reverse logistics) allows us to address the problem of removing goods after they have been labelled as obsolete. To solve this complex combinatorial optimisation problem we use Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a social-inspired algorithm. PSO aims to find a set of paths that minimises the total distance of the paths while serving, simultaneously, customers delivery and pick-up demands. Further, time windows constraints are also considered in this paper, which make the problem harder to solve. Including time windows makes also the problem more realistic, though. Results show that the PSO algorithm can find solutions that are quite competitive w.r.t. previously reported algorithms in the literature.

The disaggregated data concern the congested link travel times, which are traditionally used as variable to be minimized in VRP. The novelty of this research article consists in the introduction of spatially aggregated data, which are estimated by means of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). In a within-day dynamic context, they are a measure of reliability of travel times because they could anticipate the latter ones’ variation in the short term. The equation of reliable link travel times is composed of a congestion term, expressing the traditional congested link travel times (or generalized costs), and a reliability term, which depends on the fundamental diagram of the link and the NFD of the homogeneous cluster of adjacent links. The proposed procedure has been validated and applied for two real test cases. NFDs data are used in the proposed link travel time function to calculate reliable travel times.

Particularly, transportation cost savings could have potential impacts on marketing activities of remanufactured and recycled products in reverse logistics chains. Therefore, developing practical solutions for VRP of original and remanufactured products is one the emerging topics in the current transportation research.

Horizontal cooperation (HC) concepts represent a promising strategy to increase the performance of supply chains. HC is based on sharing resources and making joint decisions among different agents at the same level of the supply chain. This paper analyzes different cooperation scenarios concerning integrated routing and facility-location decisions in road transportation: (a) a noncooperative scenario in which all decisions are individually taken (each enterprise addresses its own vehicle routing problem [VRP]); (b) a semicooperative scenario in which route-planning decisions are jointly taken (facilities and fleets are shared and enterprises face a joint multidepot VRP); and (c) a fully cooperative scenario in which route-planning and facility-location decisions are jointly taken (also customers are shared, and thus enterprises face a general location routing problem). Our analysis explores how this increasing level of HC leads to a higher flexibility and, therefore, to a lower total distribution cost. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, combining biased randomization with a variable neighborhood search framework, is proposed to solve each scenario. This allows us to quantify the differences among these scenarios, both in terms of monetary and environmental costs.

A model of double objective programming is constructed by taking the minimum number of vehicles used and minimum vehicle traveling cost as the first and the second objective, respectively.

Containers of different types, used to collect different waste materials, once full, must be picked up to be emptied at suitable disposal plants and replaced by empty containers alike. All requests must be served, and routes are subject to a maximum duration constraint. Minimizing the number of vehicles is the main objective, while minimizing the total route duration is a secondary objective. The problem belongs to the class of rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problems (RR-VRPs), though some characteristics of the case study, such as the free circulation of containers and the limited availability of spare containers, allow us to exploit them in the solution approach. We formalize the problem as a special vehicle routing problem on a bipartite graph, we analyze its structure, and we compare it to similar problems emphasizing the impact of limited spare containers. Moreover, we propose a neighborhood-based metaheuristic that alternatively switches from one objective to the other along the search path and periodically destroys and rebuilds parts of the solution. The main algorithm components are experimentally evaluated on real and realistic instances, the largest of which fail to be solved by a mixed-integer linear programming solver. We are increasingly competitive with the solver as the instance size increases, especially regarding fleet size.

In this work the problem of the VRP work is described as follows: the vehicles which are used for transportation products toward instance place. Each vehicle begins from a major area at various times every day. The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is described as toward service a set of delivery customers by means of well-known demands, the aim of CVRP is toward giving every vehicle with a series of delivers so with the purpose of each and every one of customers are serviced, and the cost of traveling for vehicles are decreased. The paper aims to discover an optimal route for VRP by using Improvement Ant Colony System Algorithm (IACS). Optimal routes are founded based on to decrease the distance and the time for each and every one route which directs to quickest the moving of customers to their locations, also based on developing the CVRP model for optimizing the routing issues. The IACS method has been mostly considered recently for handling several combinatorial optimization issues. In this paper, the IACS has been introduced for solving the CVRP.

The rationale behind minimizing distance was perhaps that fuel consumption depends on distance traveled. Fuel consumption depends on several other factors besides distance. Recently, several authors have focused on directly minimizing total fuel consumed considering load carried and/or speed. However, it is surprising that none have considered the significant effect of acceleration on fuel consumption. Since fuel cost represents a significant fraction of operating cost, incorrect fuel consumption estimation may result in suboptimal routes and schedules. Here, we estimate fuel consumption while considering the effect of load, speed, and acceleration. We achieve this by using driving cycles (speed-time profile of a vehicle) that can be easily obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Modified versions of several standard VRP instances are used to test the effect of estimated fuel consumption using driving cycles. Test results show that using driving cycles results in an average fuel savings of 8–12% compared to using average speed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acceleration; Driving cycles; Fuel consumption minimization; Green vehicle routing problem"

Determining the locations and optimizing the routes for centralized rice drying in cold regions (cold rice) are important logistic system problems associated with the instant drying of rice. Because the ideal rice drying time in cold regions is 4-8 hours after harvest and should not exceed 8 hours, we established a location-routing problem (LRP) model with a time window to study this issue. We used a two-stage method that combined a greedy heuristic algorithm and an intelligent optimization algorithm to solve the problem. In the location-allocation problem (LAP) stage, the P-median model was established, and the optimal position of the drying center was determined via a greedy heuristic algorithm. Then, the solution was implemented in the vehicle-routing problem (VRP) phase. Based on clustering analysis, a multiple drying center VRP with a farmer's time window (MDVRPTW) was established. A genetic algorithm was used to solve for the optimal transportation route and minimum cost.

This problem becomes a special type of vehicle routing problem (VRP). Two types of scenarios are established for the bridge inspection problem. In the first scenario, only one inspection team is evaluated, and in the second scenario, more than one inspection team and a specific inspection duration are assessed.

A preventive maintenance (PM) policy is proposed which suggests performing PM actions (generally preventive replacement of the critical component) when reaching selected customers (cities). The purpose of this work is to determine simultaneously the optimal delivery sequence and the optimal sequence of PM actions (i.e. the customers cities at which PM should be performed) in order to minimize the expected total cost per time unit, considering penalties on late arrival and maintenance costs.

Green-PDPTW aims to design the route by minimising the emission of direct greenhouse gases, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These two concepts were verified by eight standard benchmark instances. DE algorithm is proposed to design the optimal route for these two problems. The computational experiments demonstrate that designing route by minimising greenhouse gases emission provides cleaner routes than designing routes by minimising total cost. However, it is not as economical as considering the minimum total cost as the objective function since it requires more vehicles and total distance than route that designed based on the minimum total cost concept.

A randomly drawn sequence of these heuristics is applied to an initial solution, after which the probabilities are updated depending on whether or not this sequence improved the objective value, hence increasing the chance of selecting the sequences that generate improved solutions. The third place method decomposes the problem into two independent parts: first, it schedules the delivery days for all requests using a genetic algorithm. Each schedule in the genetic algorithm is evaluated by estimating its cost using a deterministic routing algorithm that constructs feasible routes for each day. After spending 80 percent of time in this phase, the last 20 percent of the computation time is spent on Variable Neighborhood Descent to further improve the routes found by the deterministic routing algorithm. This article finishes with an in-depth comparison of the results of the two approaches. © 2019, The Association of European Operational Research Societies and Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.","Evolutionary computations; Inventory; Metaheuristics; Routing"

One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region.

To solve this challenging NP-hard problem, we design a new constraint relaxation-based algorithm.

This paradigm requires the development of a labeling algorithm specific to the pricing subproblem. To illustrate selective pricing, we apply it to a branch-price-and-cut algorithm for the VRP with time windows, where the relaxed pricing subproblem is a shortest ng-path problem with resource constraints. We develop a labeling algorithm for this subproblem and show through computational experiments that it can yield significant time reductions (up to 32%) to reach a good lower bound on certain very-hard-to-solve VRPTW instances with 200 customers.

The objective of this model is to minimise total cost incurred in picking up and transporting the matchboxes from the manufacturers to cross-dock, consolidating matchboxes at cross-dock, and in transporting and delivering the matchboxes to the customers.

In this context, this article presents the multi-depot vehicle routing problem based on customer's satisfaction (MDVRPCS). Since MDVRPCS is an NP-hard problem so, ant colony optimisation (ACO) has been proposed to solve the MDVRPCS. The proposed algorithms have two phases. The first phase involves clustering the nodes into a desired number of groups. This has been done by using K-means clustering algorithm. The second phase involves optimisation of routes for each cluster. This is achieved by using ACO. The proposed algorithm has been tested for well-know problem instances from the literature.

Despite these academic achievements, solving large VRP instances sufficiently fast for real-life applicability remains challenging. By exploiting VRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, this paper arrives at a powerful and fast optimization heuristic. Its primary contributions are threefold: a ruin method, a recreate method, and a fleet minimization procedure. The ruin method functions via adjacent string removal, introducing with it a novel property regarding vehicle routing problems that we term spatial slack, whereas the recreate method is categorized as greedy insertion with blinks. Combining these results in slack induction by string removals (SISRs), a powerful ruin and recreate approach. The fleet minimization procedure, meanwhile, introduces an absences-based acceptance criterion that serves as a complementary optimization component for when minimizing the number of vehicles constitutes the primary VRP objective. Together these three elements provide a suite of simple, powerful, and easily reproducible algorithmic methods that are successfully applied not only to the capacitated VRP but also to a wide range of related problems such as pickup and delivery problems and others that include time windows. SISRs serves to strip back the layers of complexity and specialization synonymous with the trend of algorithmic development throughout recent decades. Moreover, such simplicity and reproducibility are shown to not necessarily come at the expense of solution quality, with SISRs consistently outperforming alternative general approaches as well as dedicated single-purpose methods. Finally, aside from performance-related criteria, SISRs also serves to showcase a fresh perspective with respect to VRPs more generally, introducing a range of new terminology and procedures that, it is hoped, will invigorate further research and innovation. © 2020 INFORMS.","Capacity slack; Fleet minimization; Large-scale instances; Ruin and recreate; Spatial slack; String removal; Vehicle routing"

When the sum of profits is maximized under distance constraints, the problem is usually called the team orienteering problem. The capacitated profitable tour problem seeks to maximize profits minus travel costs under capacity constraints. Finally, in the VRP with a private fleet and common carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subject to a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customer's selection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route. We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems, which explores an exponential number of solutions in pseudo-polynomial time. The search is conducted with standard VRP neighborhoods on an exhaustive solution representation, visiting all customers. Since visiting all customers is usually infeasible or suboptimal, an efficient select algorithm, based on resource constrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used on any new route to find the optimal subsequence of visits to customers. The good performance of these neighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experiments with a local search, an iterated local search, and a hybrid genetic algorithm. Intriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum of this neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0.09% on classic team orienteering benchmark instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics.

The transportation cost consists of the rent charge of vehicles, fuel cost, and carbon tax. Owing to complexity of the built model, it is divided into two subproblems by a two-stage optimization approach: at the first stage, the number of vehicles is minimized, then the routing plan is optimized at the second stage. For solving the sequential subproblems, two correlated genetic algorithms are developed, which share the same initial population to reduce their computational costs.

In order to solve the OVRP, a hybrid ant colony optimization (HACO) algorithm based on random distribution of loading and dynamically encoding was proposed. Firstly, the initial solutions were obtained through the method of random loading, and the colony optimization algorithm was adopted to get the optimal solution. Then the optimal solution was encoded as the zeroth particle of particle swarm algorithm. The initial fitness values were regarded as the historical optimal solution for individual.

The use of biased randomisation techniques allows to better guide the local search process. The proposed approach for solving the 2L-VRPB is tested on an extensive set of instances, which have been adapted from existing benchmarks for the two-dimensional loading vehicle routing problem (2L-VRP). Additionally, when no backhauls are considered our algorithm is able to find new best solutions for several 2L-VRP benchmark instances with sequential oriented loading, both with and without items rotation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Metaheuristics; Packing; Routing; Transportation; Vehicle routing problem"

Ignoring these constraints impairs planning and induces last-minute changes resulting in additional costs. Developing vehicle routing models incorporating loading constraints is critical to more efficient route planning. The last couple of years has seen a huge increase of contributions to this field of research with almost 60 % of these being published after 2009. Our contribution is twofold. First, we overview the recent developments in the literature on all vehicle types in which loading constraints play a key role (trucks, airplanes, ships, and automated guided vehicles), using a state-of-the-art classification scheme to identify the loading constraints considered in each article.

A nonlinear mathematical model was developed that considered not only the vehicle routing problem with time windows but also the effect of road irregularities on the bruising of fresh fruits and vegetables. The main objective of this work was to obtain the optimal distribution routes for fresh fruits and vegetables considering different road classes with the least amount of logistics costs. An improved genetic algorithm was used to solve the problem. A fruit delivery route among the 13 cities in Jiangsu Province was used as a real analysis case. The simulation results showed that the vehicle routing problem with time windows, considering road irregularities and different classes of toll roads, can significantly influence total delivery costs compared with traditional VRP models. The comparison between four models to predict the total cost and actual total cost in distribution showed that the improved genetic algorithm is superior to the Group-based pattern, CW pattern, and O-X type cross pattern. © 2015 Peiqing Li et al.",""

In this paper we extend current E-VRP models to consider nonlinear charging functions. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed for this problem. To assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions, we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature.

The aim is to discover a set of satisfying solutions (routes) minimizing total travel distance, total tardiness time and the total number of vehicles. These routes satisfy transportation requests without contravening any of the instance specific constraints (precedence, capacity and time window constraints).

This paper introduces an experimental assessment of the impact of infeasible solutions on heuristic searches, through various empirical studies on local improvement procedures, iterated local searches, and hybrid genetic algorithms for the VRP with time windows and other related variants with fleet mix, backhauls, and multiple periods. Four relaxation schemes are considered, allowing penalized late arrivals to customers, early and late arrivals, returns in time, or a flexible travel time relaxation. For all considered problems and methods, our experiments demonstrate the significant positive impact of penalized infeasible solution. Differences can also be observed between individual relaxation schemes.

Previous studies solved the benchmark problem using DIC and CIS algorithms with the assumption that the vehicles are travelling with a static speed when collecting the waste. However, in this paper the static speed that was considered in both algorithms were improved by introducing dynamic travel speeds to construct vehicle routes for the waste collection drivers. Compared to previous studies the enhanced CIS and DIC with dynamic travel speeds affected the waste collection problem in terms of the number of vehicles used, the total distance travelled and the total travel time. However, different settings of speed may give different impacts to the solution. The study reveals that with a setting of dynamic speed between 40 mph and 55 mph, DIC is able to reduce two vehicles (from 98 to 96 number of vehicles used), 7.85% of total distance travelled, and 19.10% of total travel time.","Dynamic travel speed; Heuristics; Time-dependent vehicle routing; Waste collection"

Firstly, the heuristic called DE_G-Q-DVRP-FD is presented to determine the routing of transferring pullets from pullet houses to hen houses. Since the problem considered is very complicated, the DE_G-Q-DVRP-FD is extended to the two-phase heuristic called MESOMDE_G-Q-DVRP-FD. The difference between two heuristics is that in the MESOMDE_G-Q-DVRP-FD algorithm, the customer vertices (pullet houses) will be clustered before determining routes. The clustering of customer vertices method called the Multifactor Based Evolving Self-Organizing Map is proposed in the first phase in order to completely utilize the vehicle. Finally, in the second phase, the DE_G-Q-DVRP-FD is used to execute the routing. To demonstrate the algorithm efficiency, flock allocation from pullet houses to hen houses in the egg industry is used as the case study. The results obtained from this study show that the MESOMDE_G-Q-DVRP-FD algorithm provides lower total cost values than that of the firm’s current practice by 7.59–31.28 and 0.84–13.15 % better than the DE_G-Q-DVRP-FD algorithm. Additionally, the MESOMDE_G-Q-DVRP-FD is adjusted to solve the benchmark problem found in the literature.

The VRPSPD can arise in many transportation systems involving both distribution and collection operations. Originally, the VRPSPD assumes a homogeneous fleet of vehicles to serve the customers. However, in many practical situations, there are different types of vehicles available to perform the pickup and delivery operations. In this study, the original version of the VRPSPD is extended by assuming the fleet of vehicles to be heterogeneous. The Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD) is considered to be an NP-hard problem because it generalizes the classical VRP. For its solution, we develop a hybrid local search algorithm in which a non-monotone threshold adjusting strategy is integrated with tabu search. The threshold function used in the algorithm has an adaptive nature which makes it self-tuning. Additionally, its implementation is very simple as it requires no parameter tuning except for the tabu list length. The proposed algorithm is applied to a set of randomly generated problem instances.

An improved ant colony optimization (IACO) is proposed for solving this model. First, MDHVRPSTW is transferred into different groups according to the nearest principle, and then the initial route is constructed by the scanning algorithm (SA). Secondly, genetic operators are introduced, and crossover probability and mutation probability are adaptively adjusted in order to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Moreover, the smooth mechanism is used to improve the performance of the ant colony optimization (ACO). Finally, the 3-opt strategy is used to improve the local search ability.

A significant variant of vehicle routing problem (VRP) arises when a fleet of vehicles is characterised by different capacities and operating costs, which is known as heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP). This paper aims at determining the optimal composition of fleet and set of routes to be accomplished by a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles for serving a given set of customers with the objective of minimising the total routing cost. To obtain the solution of the HFVRP, implementations of construction heuristics (savings algorithm, nearest neighbour, branch and cut) and improvement heuristics (2-opt and or-opt) are achieved through development of a DSS which eventually leads to proposal of a hybrid heuristic for route optimisation.

They are usually known as Vehicle Routing Problems or VRPs. The related literature is quite large and diverse both in terms of variants of the problems and in terms of solving approaches. To identify the different variants of routing problems, authors generally use initialisms, in which various prefixes and suffixes indicate the presence of different assumptions or constraints. But this identification based on initialisms is inefficient. For example, two variants of a problem may be identified by the same abbreviation, whereas different abbreviations may be assigned to the same problem. This paper proposes a new notation and a new formalism to identify and to classify instances of routing problems. This contribution aims at filling in the gaps of the current identification system. The goal is to allow everyone to position his work accurately in the literature, and to easily identify approaches and results comparable to his research. The proposed notation is inspired by the scheduling formalism. It has four fields (π/α/β/γ), respectively describing the type and horizon of the problem, the system structure, resources and demands, constraints and objectives to be optimized. 26 papers from the literature chosen for their disparity are classified using this notation to illustrate its usefulness and a software tool is proposed to make its use easier. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2014.","Classification; Notation; Vehicle routing; VRP"

This is the first study of such a problem in the literature. For this reason, a benchmark composed by 15 instances has been also proposed. In the design of this benchmark, real geographical positions have been used, located in the province of Bizkaia, Spain. For the proper treatment of this AC-VRP-SPDVCFP, a discrete firefly algorithm (DFA) has been developed. This application is the first application of the firefly algorithm to any rich vehicle routing problem. To prove that the proposed DFA is a promising technique, its performance has been compared with two other well-known techniques: an evolutionary algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing.

The hub-and-spoke structure is fixed as part of strategic planning. Due to the long planning horizon of strategic planning it is often difficult to predict demand over time. Operating a certain hub-and-spoke system in case of highly variable demand during the life cycle can result in inefficiency of the transportation system. In this paper an adaptive planning system is developed that can rearrange the service areas and the depots as well as the trans-loading points between line haul and local tours of the service areas and determine new vehicle routes. Our hub-and-spoke system also allows direct service from the hub to a single customer. The re-optimization of the hub-and-spoke system is based on a solution of a multi-depot variable service areas vehicle routing problem (MD-VSA-VRP). The problem is NP-hard.

A specific index is used for quantifying the exposure of a vehicle to the risk of being robbed along its route. In addition, the problem is subject to a traditional capacity constraint, which limits the maximum amount of valuables that can be transported inside the vehicle. This constraint might be imposed, for example, by insurance companies. A biobjective formulation, aimed at reducing both risk and travel costs, is proposed. The objectives are conflicting since higher risk exposures would allow a reduction of the travel costs incurred by a transportation firm to visit all its customers for the collection of cash. A mathematical model of the problem is described and solved using a progressive multiobjective metaheuristic. Multiobjective optimization and multicriteria decision making are integrated into a single metaheuristic algorithm. To simplify the decision process, the decision maker's preferences are embedded into the multiobjective algorithm.

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) with simultaneous pick-ups and deliveries and two-dimensional loading constraints, which considers that vehicles offer simultaneous pick-up and delivery service, is used as the basis for comparisons. Two alternative strategies are considered: the VRP with backhauls and two-dimensional loading constraints, where pick-up items are collected only when the delivery items of a route have been unloaded, and the bi-directional VRP with two-dimensional loading constraints, where pick-up and delivery items are transported by different types of vehicle trips. The examined models are solved via a common local-search method for the routing aspects, integrated with a packing heuristic for developing feasible item loadings. To conduct the model comparison, we solve new benchmark instances with diverse features in terms of the graphs, the characteristics of the transported items, and the participation of pick-up items in the overall set of transported items.

Stochastic demands are only revealed when the vehicle arrives at the customer location; dynamic requests mean that new orders from previously unknown customers can be received and scheduled over time. The variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS) proposed in this study can be extended by sampling for stochastic scenarios and adapted for the dynamic setting. We use standard sets of benchmark instances to evaluate our algorithms. When applying sampling based VNS, on average we were able to improve results obtained by a classical VNS by 4.39 %. Individual instances could be improved by up to 8.12 %. In addition, the proposed VNS framework matches 32 out of 40 best known solutions and provides one new best solution. In the dynamic case, VNS improves on existing results and provides new best solutions for 7 out of 21 instances. Finally, this study offers results for stochastic and dynamic scenarios.

However, the solution approaches proposed for the VRPSPD can be directly applied to the VRPMPD. In this study, an adaptive local search solution approach is developed for both the VRPSPD and the VRPMPD, which hybridizes a Simulated Annealing inspired algorithm with Variable Neighborhood Descent. The algorithm uses an adaptive threshold function that makes the algorithm self-tuning.

An additional local search and perturbation mechanism around the border area of spatial cells is used to improve route segments across spatial cells to overcome the border effect.

This is possible with the integration of excellent solvers to software engineering methodologies that provide optimization-based decision support for planning. Since the logistics market is growing rapidly, the optimization of routing systems is of primary concern that motivates the use of vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers as software components integrated as an optimization engine. A critical success factor of routing optimization is quality vs. response time performance. Less time-consuming and more efficient automated processes can be achieved by employing stronger solution algorithms. This study aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) which is a popular extension of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem arising in real world applications where pickup and delivery operations are simultaneously taken into account to satisfy the vehicle capacity constraint with the objective of total travelled distance minimization. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on an ant colony system (ACS) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for its solution. VNS is a powerful optimization algorithm that provides intensive local search. However, it lacks a memory structure. This weakness can be minimized by utilizing long term memory structure of ACS and hence the overall performance of the algorithm can be boosted. In the proposed algorithm, instead of ants, VNS releases pheromones on the edges while ants provide a perturbation mechanism for the integrated algorithm using the pheromone information in order to explore search space further and jump from local optima. The performance of the proposed ACS empowered VNS algorithm is studied on well-known benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature of VRPSPD for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm that the developed approach is robust and very efficient in terms of both solution quality and CPU time since better results provided in a shorter time on benchmark data sets is a good performance indicator. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ant colony system; Metaheuristics; Simultaneous pickup and delivery; Time limit; Variable neighborhood search; Vehicle routing problem"

Moreover, the model considers the utilization of electric and fuel power depending on the availability of either electric charging or fuel stations. We develop simulated annealing with a restart strategy (SA_RS) to solve this problem, and it consists of two versions. The first version determines the acceptance probability of a worse solution using the Boltzmann function, denoted as SA_RSBF. The second version employs the Cauchy function to determine the acceptance probability of a worse solution, denoted as SA_RSCF. The proposed SA algorithm is first verified with benchmark data of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), with the result showing that it performs well and confirms its efficiency in solving CVRP. Further analysis show that SA_RSCF is preferable compared to SA_RSBF and that SA with a restart strategy performs better than without a restart strategy.

Many solutions for effectively solving the problem are currently being studied. By their nature, these routing problems are NP-Hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problems in which the search domains increase exponentially as they become larger, thus making it difficult to obtain solutions using an exact approach except for relatively simple and localized problems.

The objective is to minimize operational and environmental costs while respecting capacity constraints and service time windows. Costs are based on driver wages and fuel consumption, which depends on many factors, such as travel distance and vehicle load. The vehicle speeds are considered as decision variables. They complement routing decisions, impacting the total cost, the travel time between locations, and thus the set of feasible routes. We propose a method which combines a local search-based metaheuristic with an integer programming approach over a set covering formulation and a recursive speed-optimization algorithm.

The objective of CVRP is to decide the routes for a set of vehicles to serve a set of demand points while minimizing the total routing cost. SOS is a simple and powerful metaheuristic that simulates the symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by an organism for surviving in an ecosystem. As SOS is originally developed for solving continuous optimization problems, we therefore apply two solution representations, SR-1 and SR-2, to transform SOS into an applicable solution approach for CVRP and then apply a local search strategy to improve the solution quality of SOS. The original SOS uses three interaction strategies, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, to improve a candidate solution. In this improved version, we propose two new interaction strategies, namely competition and amensalism. We develop six versions of SOS for solving CVRP. The first version, SOSCanonical, utilizes a commonly used continuous to discrete solution representation transformation procedure. The second version is an improvement of canonical SOS with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSBasic. The third and fourth versions use SR-1 and SR-2 with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The fifth and sixth versions, denoted as ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2, improve the implementation of SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2 by adding the newly proposed competition and amensalism interaction strategies. The performances of SOSCanonical, SOSBasic, SOSSR-1, and SOSSR-2 are evaluated on two sets of benchmark problems. First, the results of the four versions of SOS are compared, showing that the preferable result was obtained from SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The performances of SOSSR-1, SOSSR-2, ISOSSR-1, and ISOSSR-2 are then compared, presenting that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 offer a better performance.

The results show that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 produce good VRP solutions under a reasonable computational time, indicating that each of them is a good alternative algorithm for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Metaheuristics; Solution representation; Symbiotic organisms search"

This increase may be explained by the larger amount of data available to better analyze and understand various stochastic phenomena at hand, coupled with methodological advances that have yielded solution tools capable of handling some of the computational challenges involved in such problems. In this paper, we first briefly sketch the state-of-The-Art in stochastic vehicle routing by examining the main classes of stochastic VRPs (problems with stochastic demands, with stochastic customers, and with stochastic travel or service times), the modeling paradigms that have been used to formulate them, and existing exact and approximate solution methods that have been proposed to tackle them.

To address this combinatorial optimization problem, we design and implement a hybrid heuristic model integrating a genetic algorithm, a local search mechanism and an immigration strategy. Several strategies for generating the initial population of the genetic algorithm in relation with six local search heuristics are considered. An important feature of the proposed approach refers to the immigration strategy used to ensure diversification by which the level of evolution for the new immigrant individuals increases along with the evolution of the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of HFFVRP benchmark instances and the preliminary results point out that our approach is an attractive and appropriate method to explore the solution space of this complex problem leading to good solutions within reasonable computational times. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic algorithms; Heterogeneous fixed fleet vehicle routing problem; Immigration techniques; Local search; Memetic algorithms"

Vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a well-known combinatorial problem. This article aims at studying the vehicle routing problem with time windows and target time (VRPTWTT). VRPTWTT involves the routing of a set of vehicles with limited capacity from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows as well as a target time. There are penalties associated with servicing either earlier or later than this target servicing time. The goal is to minimize the costs of transport and penalties of delay and ahead of time. Although VRPTWTT is a new variant of the VRP with time windows, the problem is not easy to solve, and it is also NP-hard. To solve the VRPTWTT, we propose a hybrid method combining Neighborhood search with Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO). Furthermore, when ACO is close to current optimal solution, neighborhood search is used to maintain the diversity of ACO and explore new solutions. First, we present a description of the hybrid method followed by computational results and the conclusion. © 2005 - 2017 JATIT & LLS.

The proposed model is extended from the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) through the inclusion of slow-steaming decision variables and constraints to manage the sharing of fuel consumption. Two cases differing in size are developed using Indonesian archipelago for the data background and three policies on fuel-consumption sharing are investigated: open policy, proportionate-sharing policy, and equal-sharing policy. The application of the collaborative model in Indonesian archipelago contributes to the scant literature in maritime logistics collaboration. The optimisation results from generated instances show that the open policy leads to minimum total fuel consumption but the unclear pattern in fuel-consumption sharing between carriers makes it impractical for planning purposes. Moreover, the fuel consumptions of the proportionate-sharing and equal-sharing policies are not significantly different but the smaller variance in the results of the proportionate-sharing policy indicates more predictability. The proportionate-sharing policy is therefore considered the most suitable for route planning.

This problem is an extension of the MDVLRP, where electric vehicles are used instead of internal combustion engine vehicles. The recent development of this model is explained by the advantages of this technology, such as the diminution of carbon dioxide emissions, and the support that they can provide to the design of the logistic and energy-support structure of electric vehicle fleets. There are many models that extend the classical VRP model to take electric vehicles into consideration, but the multi-depot case for location-routing models has not been worked out yet. Moreover, we consider the availability of two energy supply technologies: the “Plug-in” Conventional Charge technology, and Battery Swapping Stations; options in which the recharging time is a function of the amount of energy to charge and a fixed time, respectively. Three models are proposed: one for each of the technologies mentioned above, and another in which both options are taken in consideration. The models were solved for small scale instances using C++ and Cplex 12.5. The results show that the models can be used to design logistic and energy-support structures, and compare the performance of the different options of energy supply, as well as measure the impact of these decisions on the overall distance traveled or other optimization objectives that could be worked on in the future. © 2018 Growing Science Ltd.

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) can be defined as the determination of the optimal routes which meet the delivery (or pickup) demands from the depot to the customers. In the real life applications of logistics, vehicles in a fleet may differ from each other. In addition, the requirements arising from customers/goods may reveal the necessity to use different vehicles. Besides, companies do care more about the management of reverse flow of products, semi-finished and raw materials because of their economic benefits and as well as legal and environmental liabilities. In this paper, a variant of the VRP is considered with heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and simultaneous pickup and delivery. This problem is referred to Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD). The HVRPSPD can be defined as determining the routes and the vehicle types on each route while minimizing the total cost. In this paper, a polynomial sized flow-based mathematical model is proposed for the HVRPSPD. Since the HVRPSPD is in the class of NP-hard problems, it is difficult to find the optimal solution in a reasonable time even for the moderate size problems. Therefore, a simple and constructive heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the medium and large scale HVRPSPD s. This algorithm is the adaptation of very well-known Clarke-Wright Savings approach, which has originally developed for the VRP, to the HVRPSPD. The performances of the proposed mathematical model and the heuristic algorithm have been examined on the test problems.","Clarke-Wright savings algorithm; Heterogeneous fleet; Heuristics; Mixed integer programming formulation; Simultaneous pickup and delivery; Vehicle routing problem"

However, most VRP-related academic articles assume the existence of a homogeneous fleet of vehicles and/or a symmetric cost matrix. These assumptions are not always reasonable in real-life scenarios. To contribute in closing this gap between theory and practice, we propose a hybrid methodology for solving the asymmetric and heterogeneous vehicle routing problem (AHVRP). In our approach, we consider: 1) different types of vehicle loading capacities (heterogeneous fleets); 2) asymmetric distance-based costs. The proposed approach combines a randomised version of a well-known savings heuristic with several local searches specifically adapted to deal with the asymmetric nature of costs. A computational experiment allows us to discuss the efficiency of our approach and also to analyse how routing costs vary when slight departures from the homogeneous fleet assumption are considered.

In this work, the allocation and ordering of field paths among a number of available machines has been transformed into a VRP that enables optimization of completion time for the entire field. A basic heuristic algorithm (a modified form of the common Clarke-Wright algorithm) and a meta-heuristic algorithm, Tabu Search, were employed for optimization. Both techniques were evaluated through computer simulations in two fields: a hypothetical basic rectangular field and a more complex, real-world field. Field completion times and effective field capacity were calculated for cases when 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 vehicles were used simultaneously. Although the Tabu Search method required more than two hours to produce its solution on an Intel i7 processor compared to less than one second for the method based on Clarke-Wright, Tabu Search provided better solutions that resulted in reduced field completion times and increased effective field capacity. The benefit provided by Tabu Search was larger in the more complex field and as the number of vehicles increased. With ten vehicles in the real-world field, the benefit provided by Tabu Search over the modified Clarke-Wright resulted in reduced completion time of 32%, but even with only three vehicles a 15% reduction was obtained. While ten vehicles may only be applicable with future autonomous machines, simultaneous usage of three machines is not uncommon in current production. As producers consider using multiple machines to improve field completion times and effective field capacity, optimization of the vehicle routing will play an important role in ensuring those improvements are fully realized. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural machinery; Effective field capacity; Field efficiency; Simulation; Tabu Search; Vehicle Routing Problem"

The proposed algorithm uses two of the four basic parameters of velocity and gravitational force in physics based on the concepts of random search and searching agents, which are a collection of masses that interact with each other based on Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The introduced method was quantitatively compared with the State-of-the-Art algorithms in terms of execution time and number of optimal solutions achieved in four well-known benchmark problems. Our experiments illustrated that the proposed method could be a very efficient method in solving CVRP and the results are comparable with the results using state-of-the-art computational methods.

In order to partially close this literature gap, this paper first proposes a competitive metaheuristic algorithm based on a variable neighbourhood search framework for the deterministic waste collection problem. Then, this metaheuristic is extended to a simheuristic algorithm in order to deal with the stochastic problem version. This extension is achieved by integrating simulation into the metaheuristic framework, which also allows a closer risk analysis of the best-found stochastic solutions.

The problem also includes docking constraints in which some vehicles are unable to serve some particular customers, and a realistic objective function with vehicles' fixed and distance-based costs and a cost per customer visited.

This appreciation, coupled with the advances of numerous applications in the vehicle routing problem (VRP) across numerous practical contexts, presents an opportunity to explore the open VRP with cross-docking (OVRPCD). We introduce a general example in retail wherein the capital expenditure necessary in vehicle acquisition can become a burden for the retailer, who then needs to consider outsourcing a logistics service as a cost-effective option. This practical scenario can be applied to create an open flow network of routes. This study considers a single product and single cross-dock wherein capacitated homogeneous vehicles start at different pickup points and times during pickup operations. The vehicles are scheduled to route in the network synchronously to arrive at the cross-dock center simultaneously. In the delivery operations, all customers must be served at most once and deliveries should be finished within a predetermined duration. We model OVRPCD as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total cost (vehicle hiring cost and transportation cost). A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. SA is first verified by solving benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking and comparing the results with those obtained by existing state-of-art algorithms. We then test SA on three sets of OVRPCD benchmark instances and the results are compared with those obtained by CPLEX. Computational results show that both CPLEX and SA can obtain optimal solutions to all small and medium instances. However, the computational time required by SA is shorter than that needed by CPLEX. Moreover, for large instances, SA outperforms CPLEX in both solution value and computational time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-docking; Open vehicle routing problem; Simulated annealing"

Throughout the day, large volumes of partially processed mail must be transferred between workstations in accordance with narrow time windows and a host of operational constraints. To facilitate management supervision, it is first necessary to cluster the pickup and delivery points into zones. Given these zones, the first objective is to solve a VRP to minimize the number of vehicles required to satisfy all demand requests and, second, tominimize the total distance traveled. A solution consists of an invariant assignment of vehicles to zones and a routing plan for each 8-hour shift of the day. The clustering is performed with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, and two heuristics are developed to find solutions to the VRP,which proved intractable for realistic instances. The heuristics are optimization based within a rolling horizon framework. The first uses a fixed time increment and the second a fixed number of requests for each subproblem. The respective solutions are pieced together to determine the “optimal”fleet size and set of routes. An extensive analysiswas undertaken to evaluate the relative performance of the two heuristics and to better understand howsolution quality is affected by changes in parameter values, including sub-problem size, vehicle speed, number of zones, and time window length.

LDVRP is applicable for transportation activities where the weight of the transported cargo accounts for a significant part of the vehicle gross weight. Contrary to the basic VRP which calls for the minimization of the distance travelled, the LDVRP objective is aimed at minimizing the total product of the distance travelled and the gross weight carried along this distance. Thus, it is capable of producing sensible routing plans which take into account the variation of the cargo weight along the vehicle trips. The LDVRP objective is closely related to the total energy requirements of the vehicle fleet, making it a credible alternative when the environmental aspects of transportation activities are examined and optimized. A novel LDVRP extension which considers simultaneous pick-up and delivery service is introduced, formulated and solved for the first time. To deal with large-scale instances of the examined problems, we propose a local-search algorithm. Towards an efficient implementation, the local-search algorithm employs a computational scheme which calculates the complex weighted-distance objective changes in constant time. Solution results are presented for both problems on a variety of well-known test cases demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach. The structure of the obtained LDVRP and VRP solutions is compared in pursuit of interesting conclusions on the relative suitability of the two routing models, when the decision maker must deal with the weighted distance objective. In addition, results of a branch-and-cut procedure for small-scale instances of the LDVRP with simultaneous pick-ups and deliveries are reported. Finally, extensive computational experiments have been performed to explore the managerial implications of three key problem characteristics, namely the deviation of customer demands, the cargo to tare weight ratio, as well as the size of the available vehicle fleet. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cargo weight; Energy requirements; Local search; Vehicle routing"

The HLRP is very difficult to be solved since it is composed of two NP-hard problems, the HLP and the MH-VRP. To solve these problems simultaneously we present a novel solution framework which divides the problem into two sub-problems: HLP in the first stage and the MH-VRP in the second one. The two-phase approach hybridizes two bio-inspired computing techniques, an ant colony optimization algorithm for the first stage with a genetic algorithm for the second stage, respectively. We determine the locations of prescribed p hubs within a set of candidate potential parcel sorting centers (PSC), the allocation of each customer node to each selected PSC as well as the vehicle routes for each PSC in order to minimize the sum of the fixed hub costs, traveling costs and fixed vehicle costs.

In this study, the C&W algorithm is adopted for the cumulative VRP with limited duration (CumVRP-LD) where load is also considered in the objective function as well as distance. The most common applications of cumulative VRPs are the determination of routing policies that minimize total fuel consumption.

The objective of this article it to optimise the total distance required to deliver the goods and also the workload imbalance in terms of distances travelled by the vehicles and their loads. Due to the combinatorial in nature, it requires metaheuristic to solve these types of problems and this is a rapidly growing field of research. Here two metaheuristics such as ant colony optimisation (ACO) and simulated annealing (SA) are proposed and analysed for solving this multi-objective formulation of the vehicle routing problem.

The proposed algorithms use the ratio between the customer demands and the polar coordinates as ordering criteria. The proposed heuristics are based on three steps. In the first step, a giant tour is constructed by using two new ordering criteria. Next, the split procedure is applied to get feasible routes subject to the vehicles' capacities.

Thus, this paper proposes the split-delivery weighted vehicle routing problem (SDWVRP), which consists of constructing the optimal routes, with respect to the constraints on vehicle capacity and cargo weight, to serve a given set of customers with the minimum cost. A Max-Min Ant System (MMAS-SD) algorithm to solve the SDWVRP is developed and a set of theorems and corollaries are proposed to provide an easy approach for route splitting in a typical Weighted VRP (WVRP). The benefit of Split-Delivery for WVRP, as compared to that of SDVRP, primarily lies in its impact on the geographic position and loading weight feature. Large sets of benchmark instances, which are classified into cluster, random and mix types of the three different distribution types, are calculated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDWVRP modeling. In addition, the comparison between SDWVRP and WVRP is also carried out via analysis of vehicle numbers, total cost-savings, and the impact of weight variance and mean weight on the ratio of cost-savings and related vehicle numbers of SDWVRP over WVRP to demonstrate the superiority of SDWVRP in determining optimal routes and resulting in substantial cost savings. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid premature convergence, classified update strategies were used to increase population diversity.

This VRP is rather challenging as it combines several synchronisation constraints occurring in other well-known standard VRP.

In classical VRP and its variants, the vehicle load is often regarded as a constant during transportation; therefore the loading cost associated with the amount of the load on the vehicle, are neglected in the objective function when optimizing a vehicle routine. However, in real-world, the vehicle load varies from one customer to another in a vehicle route. Thus, the vehicle route without considering the effect of loading cost may lead to sub-optimal routes. In this paper, we investigate VRP with loading cost (VRPLC), which considers the costs associated with the amount of the load on the vehicle when determining the vehicle routes. Considering the features of the VRPLC, a scatter search (SS) is proposed. By introducing customer-oriented three-dimensional encoding method, sweep algorithm and optimal splitting procedure are combined to obtain better trial solutions. The arc combination and improved nearest neighbor heuristic are adopted as a solution combination method and an improvement method to generate and improve new solutions, respectively. Computational experiments were carried out on benchmark problems of capacitated VRP with seven categories of distribution scenarios.

Thereby, a lower bound on the total customer demand to be served by the private fleet guarantees a high utilization of the fleet capacity.

In specific, it presents a strategy for reducing the computational complexity required for applying local search to tackle various combinatorial optimization problems. The value of this contribution is two-fold. It helps practitioners design efficient local search implementations, and it facilitates the application of robust commercial local search-based algorithms to practical instances of very large size. The central rationale underlying the proposed complexity reduction strategy is straightforward: when a local search operator is applied to a given solution, only a limited part of this solution is modified. Thus, to exhaustively examine the neighborhood of the new solution, only the tentative moves that refer to the modified solution part have to be evaluated. To reduce the complexity of neighborhood evaluation, the static move descriptor (SMD) data structures are introduced, which encode local search moves in a systematic and solution independent manner. The proposed strategy is applied to the vehicle routing problem (VRP) which is of high importance both from the practical and theoretical viewpoints. The use of the SMD concept, for encoding three commonly applied quadratic local search operators, results into a VRP local search method which exhibits an almost linearithmic complexity in respect to the instance size. Furthermore, exploiting the SMD representation of tentative moves, a metaheuristic strategy is proposed, which is aimed at diversifying the conducted search via a simple penalization policy. The proposed metaheuristic was tested on various large and very large scale VRP benchmark instances. It produced fine results, and managed to improve several best known solutions. The method was also executed on real-world instances of 3000 customers, the data of which reflects the actual geographic distribution of customers within four major cities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its wide practical applicability the MC-VRP has not received much attention in the literature, and the few existing methods assume perfect knowledge of the customer demands, regardless of their stochastic nature. This paper extends the MC-VRP by introducing uncertainty on what it is known as the MC-VRP with stochastic demands (MC-VRPSD). The MC-VRPSD is modeled as a stochastic program with recourse and solved by means of a memetic algorithm. The proposed memetic algorithm couples genetic operators and local search procedures proven to be effective on deterministic routing problems with a novel individual evaluation and reparation strategy that accounts for the stochastic nature of the problem. The algorithm was tested on instances of up to 484 customers, and its results were compared to those obtained by a savings-based heuristic and a memetic algorithm (MA/SCS) for the MC-VRP that uses a spare capacity strategy to handle demand fluctuations. In addition to effectively solve the MC-VRPSD, the proposed MA/SCS also improved 14 best known solutions in a 40-problem testbed for the MC-VRP. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Today manufacturers have become much more concerned with coordinating the operations of manufacturing (for new products) and recycling (for reuse of resources) together with scheduling the forward/reverse flows of goods over a supply chain network. The stochastic travel-time vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-ups and deliveries (STT-VRPSPD) is one of the major operations problems in bi-directional supply chain research. The STT-VRPSPD is a very challenging and difficult combinatorial optimization problem due to many reasons such as a non-monotonic increase or decrease of vehicle capacity and the stochasticity of travel times. In this paper, we develop a new scatter search (SS) approach for the STT-VRPSPD by incorporating a new chance-constrained programming method. A generic genetic algorithm (GA) approach for STT-VRPSPD is also developed and used as a reference for performance comparison.

Split procedures have proved their efficiency for those problems, especially within global optimization frameworks. The purpose is to build a feasible routing solution by splitting a giant tour into trips. This is done by computing a shortest path on an auxiliary graph built from the giant tour. One of the latest advances consists in handling extra resource constraints through the generation of labels on the nodes of the auxiliary graph. Lately, the development of a new generic split family based on a Depth First Search (DFS) approach during label generation has highlighted the efficiency of this new method for the routing problems, through extensive numerical evaluations on the location-routing problem. In this paper, we present a hybrid Evolutionary Local Search (hybrid ELS) for non-homogeneous fleet Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) based on the application of split strategies. Experiments show our method is able to handle all known benchmarks, from Vehicle Fleet Mix Problems to Heterogeneous Fleet VRP (HVRP). We also propose a set of new realistic HVRP instances from 50 to more than 250 nodes coming from French counties. It relies on real distances in kilometers between towns. Since many classical HVRP instance sets are solved to optimality, this new set of instances could allow a fair comparative study of methods.

Given a fleet of vehicles, daily routes have to be designed in order to minimize the total traveled distance while balancing the workload of drivers. This balance has been defined in relation to the length of the routes, regarding to the required time. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear model for the problem is proposed and a solution approach, based on the scatter search metaheuristic, is developed. An extensive computational experience is carried out, using benchmark instances with 25, 50 and 100 customers, to test several components of the proposed method. Comparisons with the exact Pareto fronts for instances up to 25 customers show that the proposed methods obtain good approximations. For comparison purposes, an NSGA-II algorithm has also been implemented. Results obtained on a real case instance are also discussed.

In the transportation business, time windows are not always strictly obeyed and the deviation of service time from the customer-specific time window determines the customer's satisfaction level, which can also be regarded as the supplier's service level. This paper applies fuzzy membership functions to characterize the service level issues associated with time window violation in a vehicle routing problem and proposes VRPFTW. VRPFTW is formulated as a multi-objective model with two goals: (1) to minimize the travel distance and (2) to maximize the service level of the supplier to customers. To solve this multi-objective model, a two-stage algorithm is developed to obtain a Pareto solution for VRPFTW. Using the two-stage algorithm, VRPFTW is decomposed into two subproblems, namely a traditional vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW-α) and a service improvement problem, and each of the objectives is sequentially solved. The service improvement problem is solved under two different scenarios. When the fuzzy membership function is linear, it is shown that the service improvement problem can be solved by the cutting plane algorithm within finite iterations, and when the fuzzy membership function is concave, the service improvement problem can be solved by a subgradient-based algorithm. Moreover, an alternative formulation of VRPFTW is also proposed and analyzed. Experiments are conducted to compare different models of vehicle routing problems with time windows in situations where violation of time windows is allowed, and the results show that the VRPFTW model can achieve considerable cost-savings, while at the same time maintaining an acceptable service level.","Fuzzy constraints; Multi-objective programming; Service level; Time windows; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)"

These requirements have to be met by the serving vehicles. No further constraints, like capacity or cost restrictions, are imposed. Skill VRP solutions may show a tendency to have a bad load balancing and resource utilization. In a majority of solutions only a subset of vehicles is active. Moreover, a considerable share of demand nodes is served by vehicles that have a skill higher than necessary. A reason for that solution behavior lies in the model itself. As no resource restrictions are imposed, the Skill VRP tends to produce TSP-like solutions. To obtain better balanced solutions, we introduce two new approaches. First we propose a minmax model that aims at minimizing the maximal vehicle tour length. Second we suggest a two-step method combining the minmax approach with a distance constrained model. Our experiments illustrate that these approaches lead to improvements in load balancing and resource utilization, but, with different impact on routing costs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Distance constrained VRP; Dominance; Mathematical model; Minmax; Site-dependent VRP"

These approaches are designed and optimized for specific types of vehicle routing problems (VRPs). VRPs appearing in practice typically accommodate restrictions that are not accommodated in classical VRP models, such as time-dependent travel times and driving hours regulations. We present a new construction framework for solving VRPs that can handle a wide range of different types of VRPs. In addition, this framework accommodates various restrictions that are not considered in classical vehicle routing models, but that regularly appear in practice. Within this framework, restricted dynamic programming is applied to the VRP through the giant-tour representation. This algorithm is a construction heuristic which for many types of restrictions and objective functions leads to an optimal algorithm when applied in an unrestricted way. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework for various restrictions appearing in practice. The computational experiments demonstrate that the framework competes with state of the art local search methods when more realistic constraints are considered than in classical VRPs.

In this problem, the loads consist of a set of three-dimensional, rectangular shaped items. The fleet is composed of heterogeneous vehicles with different weight and space capacities. The objective is to serve all customers by selecting a set of vehicles such that the total transportation cost is minimized. The cost consists of the fixed cost of the selected vehicles and their travel cost. In addition, loading sequence related constraints frequently encountered in realistic applications are respected when loading and unloading the items. To solve this challenging problem, we develop an adaptive variable neighborhood search (AVNS) which utilizes an extreme point based first fit heuristic to find a feasible loading pattern for each route. We design two strategies to accelerate the loading and routing processes. The Trie data structure is used to record the loading information of routes already visited and to control the computational effort spent for each route. The Fibonacci heap data structure is used to maintain all of the possible moves and vehicle type assignments, which avoids the duplicated evaluation of some moves and unnecessary loading check of unpromising solutions. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by computational tests performed both on some newly generated 3L-HFVRP instances and well-known benchmark instances from the literature for two simplified VRP variants: the capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3D loading constraints (3L-CVRP) and the pure heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP). The numerical experiments show that the proposed AVNS outperforms other algorithms in 3L-CVRP and improves several best known solutions reported in the literature. The results obtained for the pure HFVRP are very close to the best known solutions. © 2014 IEEE.",""

Many exact, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed to solve VRP. An important variant of the VRP arises when a eet of vehicles is fixed and characterised by different capacities for distribution activities. The problem is known as the heterogeneous fixed fleet VRP (HFFVRP). The HFFVRP is a natural generalisation of the VRP with several vehicle types, each type being defined by a capacity, a fixed cost and a cost per distance unit, and can cover more practical situations in transportation. This problem consists of determining a set of vehicle trips of minimum total length in which a set of customers is to be satisfied in the demand constraints using identical vehicles with limited capacity. If open routes instead of closed ones are considered in the HFFVRP, the problem becomes a heterogeneous fixed fleet Open VRP (HFFOVRP) which has numerous applications in industrial and service problems. In this paper, a bone route algorithm which uses the tabu search as an improved procedure is utilised to solve the HFFOVRP. The proposed algorithm was tested empirically on a 24 of generated VRPs, and compared with elite ant system and ant colony system.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective iterated local search algorithm for the VRPB. Its main component is an oscillating local search heuristic that has two main features. First, it explores a broad neighborhood structure at each iteration. This is efficiently done using a data structure that stores information about the set of neighboring solutions. Second, the heuristic performs constant transitions between feasible and infeasible portions of the solution space. These transitions are regulated by a dynamic adjustment of the penalty applied to infeasible solutions. An extensive statistical analysis was carried out in order to identify the most important components of the algorithm and to properly tune the values of their parameters. The results of the computational experiments carried out show that this algorithm is very competitive in comparison to the best metaheuristic algorithms for the VRPB. Additionally, new best solutions have been found for two instances in one of the benchmark sets. These results show that the performance of existing metaheuristic algorithms can be considerably improved by carrying out a thorough statistical analysis of their components. In particular, it shows that by expanding the exploration area and improving the efficiency of the local search heuristic, it is possible to develop simpler and faster metaheuristic algorithms without compromising the quality of the solutions obtained. ©.","Iterated local search; Metaheuristic; Oscillating local search; Vehicle routing problem"

The focal point of distribution logistics is the shipment of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer. The products can be delivered to a customer directly either from the production facility or from the trader's stock located close to the production site or, probably, via additional regional distribution warehouses. These kinds of distribution logistics are mathematically represented as a vehicle routing problem (VRP), a well-known nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem of operations research. VRP is more suited for applications having one warehouse. In reality, however, many companies and industries possess more than one distribution warehouse. These kinds of problems can be solved with an extension of VRP called multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). MDVRP is an NP-hard and combinatorial optimization problem. MDVRP is an important and challenging problem in logistics management. It can be solved using a search algorithm or metaheuristic and can be viewed as searching for the best element in a set of discrete items.

However, previous formulations of selective VRPs have all been deterministic. Three new formulations are proposed to account for different optimization strategies under uncertain demand (or utility) level: reliable, robust, and fuzzy selective vehicle routing problems. Three parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) and a classic genetic algorithm are developed and compared to the deterministic solution. PGAs differ based on their communication strategies and diversity in sub-populations.

From a depot with identical vehicles of limited capacity, it consists in determining a set of vehicle trips of minimum total length, to satisfy the demands of a set of customers. In general, the number of vehicles used is a decision variable. The heterogeneous fleet VRP (HFVRP or HVRP) is a natural generalization with several vehicle types, each type being defined by a capacity, a fixed cost, a cost per distance unit and a number of vehicles available. The vehicle fleet mix problem (VFMP) is a variant with an unlimited number of vehicles per type. This paper presents two memetic algorithms (genetic algorithms hybridized with a local search) able to solve both the VFMP and the HVRP. They are based on chromosomes encoded as giant tours, without trip delimiters, and on an optimal evaluation procedure which splits these tours into feasible trips and assigns vehicles to them. The second algorithm uses a distance measure in solution space to diversify the search. Numerical tests on standard VFMP and HFVRP instances show that the two methods, especially the one with distance measure, compete with published metaheuristics and improve several best-known solutions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cargo trucks must comply with a mandatory lower carbon emissions policy: the emissions of large-volume cargo truck/containers depend greatly on the cargo loading and the traveling distance. To address this issue, instead of assuming a constant vehicle loading from one customer to another, a variable vehicle loading should be used in optimizing the vehicle routine, which is known as a weighted vehicle routing problem (WVRP) model. The WVRP is an NP-hard problem; thus, the purpose of this paper is to develop a BEAM-MMAS algorithm that combines a MAX-MIN ant system with beam search to show that the WVRP is more effective than the VRP and to determine the types of VRP instances for which the WVRP has more cost-savings than the VRP. To this end, computational experiments are carried out on benchmark problems of the capacitated VRP for seven types of distributions, and the effectiveness of the BEAM-MMAS algorithm is compared with that of general ACO and MMAS algorithms for large-size benchmarking instances. The benchmarking tests show that lower operation costs are produced using the WVRP than using the optimal or best known paths of the CVRP and that the WVRP can increase cost savings for the instances with a dispersed customer distribution and a large weight. Note to Practitioners-The VRP is a well-known operations research model for a class of transportation and logistics management problems in industrial systems. Large-scale problems arise in practice in production systems, e.g., charge planning, casting planning, and rolling planning in an iron-steel making process, which can be formulated as variants of the VRP model. This paper is motivated by practical needs for clean production and cost-savings, lower carbon emission policies and the observation that most VRP models neglect the effect of the cargo weight on the total costs. The WVRP model incorporates the cargo weight into the optimization objective function, resulting in an exact formulation. This model can be applied to logistics and transportation management problems in industrial systems and is particularly useful given the mandatory lower carbon emissions policy. The WVRP model results in higher cost savings than traditional VRP models for instances with a dispersed customer distribution and a large weight.

A random insertion heuristic is used to construct initial solutions and to reconstruct the existing ones. The location where a randomly chosen node will be inserted is selected by calculating an objective function. The process of random insertion preserves stochastic characteristics of the genetic algorithm and preserves feasibility of generated individuals. The defined crossover and mutation operators incorporate random insertion heuristics, analyse individuals and select which parts should be reinserted. Additionally, the second population is used in the mutation process. The second population increases the probability that the solution, obtained in the mutation process, will survive in the first population and increase the probability to find the global optimum. The result comparison shows that the solutions, found by the proposed algorithm, are similar to the optimal solutions obtained by other genetic algorithms.

Nowadays, generalizations of VRP have been developed for tactical or strategic decision levels of companies but not both. The tactical extension or periodic VRP (PVRP) plans a set of trips over a multiperiod horizon, subject to frequency constraints. The strategic extension is motivated by interdependent depot location and routing decisions in most distribution systems. Low-quality solutions are obtained if depots are located first, regardless of the future routes. In the location-routing problem (LRP), location and routing decisions are tackled simultaneously. Here for the first time, except for some conference papers, the goal is to combine the PVRP and LRP into an even more realistic problem covering all decision levels: the periodic LRP or PLRP. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve large size instances of the PLRP. First, an individual representing an assignment of customers to combinations of visit days is randomly generated. The evolution operates through an Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) on visit day assignments. The algorithm is hybridized with a heuristic based on the Randomized Extended Clarke and Wright Algorithm (RECWA) to create feasible solutions and stops when a given number of iterations is reached. The method is evaluated over three sets of instances, and solutions are compared to the literature on particular cases such as one-day horizon (LRP) or one depot (PVRP).

The problem consists in defining a minimum cost set of routes for a fleet of vehicles that meets the demands of products for a set of suppliers and customers. The vehicles leave a single Cross-Dock (CD) towards the suppliers, pick up products and return to the CD, where products can be exchanged before being delivered to their customers. The vehicle routes must respect the vehicle capacity constraints, as well as the time window constraints. We adapted a constructive heuristic and six local search procedures from the literature of VRP, and made them efficient in the presence of the synchronization constraints of VRPCD. Besides, we propose three Iterated Local Search (Lourenço et al., 2010) heuristics for VRPCD. The first heuristic is a standard implementation of ILS, while the second extends the classic ILS framework by keeping a set of elite solutions, instead of a single current solution. The latter set is used in a restart procedure. As far as we can tell, this is the first ILS heuristic in the literature that keeps a population of current elite solutions. The third heuristic is an extension of the second that relies on an intensification procedure based on an Integer Programming formulation for the Set Partitioning problem. The latter allows a neighborhood with an exponential number of neighbors to be efficiently evaluated. We report computational results and comparisons with the best heuristics in the literature. Besides, we also present a new set with the largest instances in the literature of VRPCD, in order to demonstrate that the improvements we propose for the ILS metaheuristic are efficient even for large size instances. Results show that the best of our heuristics is competitive with the best heuristics in the literature of VRPCD. Besides, it improved the best solution known for half of the benchmark instances in the literature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Examination of the VRP literature indicates that the min-max VRP has received less attention than other variants have over the years. However, the problem has important practical applications, such as those related to routing school buses. In this setting, in addition to the min-max criterion imposed on the time it takes to complete the longest route, school districts are concerned with the minimization of the total distance traveled, which is the objective of the classical VRP. Hence, the problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization model that trades off service (i.e., the minimization of the longest route) and operational cost (i.e., the minimization of the total distance traveled). We develop a solution procedure for this problem by applying tabu search within the framework of Multiobjective Adaptive Memory Programming and compare it to an implementation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-a wellknown approach to multiobjective optimization. We also assess the merit of the solution method by comparing our approximations with solution frontiers obtained with an ε-constraint implementation. © 2013 INFORMS.","Bi-objective optimization; Metaheuristics; Routing"

The MDVRPTW is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem due to the many complex constraints involved. The research presented in this paper proposes a multiple ant colony system (MACS) to solve the problem. In addition, two hybrid algorithms, which combine the strengths of MACS and simulated annealing, are developed to improve solution quality.

The logistics system between the distribution company and the parent company which owns all the plants is operated on a two-echelon framework; the manufactured commodities are first transported from the plant to the main depot in close proximity of each plant by the plant management and then from the depot to the dealers by the distribution company. Thus, it is just necessary for the distribution company to schedule the delivery from the depots to the dealers. Since each plant manufactures a different commodity and they are located far away from each other, the company management has decided to plan each depot independently. The main issue is to design a fast and robust procedure to solve a single-depot VRP for each plant. Since the VRP is a hard, combinatorial problem, and only relatively small instances can be solved to optimality, an approximate approach is prefered to manage the large number of dealers assigned to each depot. Specifically a tabu search approach known to provide good solutions in the VRP context is employed to obtain a practical solution. The algorithm developed in this study is then tested upon the benchmark problems in literature and shown to provide competitive results. The company management was satisfied with theoretical performance and accepted to use it in their daily operation. The early findings in practice also indicate considerable improvements in operational performance. The purpose of this study is to develop a new tabu seach heuristic to solve the single-depot vehicle routing problem of a distribution company carrying goods from a depot to a set of dedicated dealers. The heuristic proposes a new neighbourhood generation procedure which considers the scattering pattern in the locations of the dealers. A set of neighbours are generated by first executing a procedure which ignores the clustering of the vertices and then executing a second procedure which takes into account the relative locations of the dealers; then the feasible non-tabu move among these with the best objective function value is implemented. During neighbourhood construction, a combination of traditional improvement techniques are used simultaneously in order to achieve the exchange of vertices. The intensification efforts, on the other hand, are focused upon the hill-climbing behaviour of the search, and the diversification step which is standard in all previous tabu search approaches is not included in this heuristic. Numerical results on well-known benchmark problems indicate that the performance of the algorithm developed in this study is compatible with the other best-known algorithms in the literature.; The purpose of this study is to develop a new tabu search heuristic to solve the single-depot vehicle routing problem of a distribution company carrying goods from a depot to a set of dedicated dealers.

In some real-world situations, the cost of routes is independent on their length, but it is dependent to type and capacity of vehicles allocated to routes where the fleet is mainly heterogeneous. In this case, the route length or travel time is expressed as restriction, that is implicated a hard time window in depot. The proposed model is solved by a hybrid simulated annealing (SA) based on the nearest neighborhood. It is shown that the proposed model enables to establish routes to serve all given customers by the minimum number of vehicles and the maximum capacity used. Also, the proposed heuristic can find good solutions in reasonable time. A number of small and large-scale problems in little and large scale are solved and the associated results are reported. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The VRPTW is NP-Complete and instances with 100 customers or more are very hard to solve optimally. We represent the VRPTW as a multi-objective problem and present a genetic algorithm solution using the Pareto ranking technique. We use a direct interpretation of the VRPTW as a multi-objective problem, in which the two objective dimensions are number of vehicles and total cost (distance). An advantage of this approach is that it is unnecessary to derive weights for a weighted sum scoring formula. This prevents the introduction of solution bias towards either of the problem dimensions. We argue that the VRPTW is most naturally viewed as a multi-objective problem, in which both vehicles and cost are of equal value, depending on the needs of the user. A result of our research is that the multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm returns a set of solutions that fairly consider both of these dimensions. Our approach is quite effective, as it provides solutions competitive with the best known in the literature, as well as new solutions that are not biased toward the number of vehicles.

Deliveries are supplied from a single depot at the beginning of the vehicle's service, while pick-up loads are taken to the same depot at the conclusion of the service. One important characteristic of this problem is that a vehicle's load in any given route is a mix of pick-up and delivery loads. In this paper we develop a tabu search algorithm to solve VRP_SPD. This algorithm uses three types of movements to obtain inter-route adjacent solutions: the relocation, interchange and crossover movements. A 2-opt procedure is used to obtain alternative intra-route solutions. Four types of neighbourhoods were implemented, three of them defined by the use of each of the single inter-route movements and the fourth by using a combination of these movements. Two different search strategies were implemented for selecting the next movement: first admissible movement and best admissible movement.

Because the number of variables and equations is vast, finding the exact solution for this problem under real conditions is difficult; only heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms can be used to solve it. Recently, the ejection chain method (ECM) has been introduced as a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds a new neighbor solution. In a case study in developing countries, efficiency of several heuristic algorithms including ECM along with one metaheuristic algorithm-tabu search algorithm (TSA)-is verified for solving large-scale problems. Additionally, capacity limitation, which is usually ignored in VRP and SBRP algorithms such as ECM, is considered as a restricting condition in this study's models. This study will show that neither the ECM used individually nor its combination with TSA produces feasible solutions for real-life scenarios. The authors have developed two innovative heuristic algorithms, the construction feasible solutions and the changing algorithm, that-when used in combination with TSA and ECM-generate a practical and efficient procedure called the mixed algorithm (MA). Addressing vehicles' capacity is mainly performed by the construction of feasible solutions (solutions satisfying capacity limitations as well) from the infeasible solutions that might result from the TSA and ECM. The changing algorithm is responsible for generating a local optimum for every resulting feasible solution. Data from bus routing of a middle school were used to show the effectiveness of the MA.",""

The route-directed hybrid genetic approach is based upon the simultaneous evolution of two populations of solutions focusing on separate objectives subject to temporal constraint relaxation. While the first population evolves individuals to minimize total traveled distance the second aims at minimizing temporal constraint violation to generate a feasible solution. Genetic operators have been designed to capture key concepts from successful routing techniques to further enhance search diversification and intensification. A master-slave message-passing paradigm characterizes the parallel procedure. The master component controls the execution of the algorithm, coordinates genetic operations and handles parent selection while the slave elements concurrently execute reproduction and mutation operators. Providing additional speed-up, the parallel algorithm further expands on its sequential counterpart, matching or even improving solution quality.

The location-routing problem (LRP) overcomes this drawback by simultaneously tackling location and routing decisions. This paper presents a cooperative metaheuristic to solve the LRP with capacitated routes and depots. The principle is to alternate between a depot location phase and a routing phase, exchanging information on the most promising edges. In the first phase, the routes and their customers are aggregated into supercustomers, leading to a facility-location problem, which is then solved by a Lagrangean relaxation of the assignment constraints. In the second phase, the routes from the resulting multidepot vehicle-routing problem (VRP) are improved using a granular tabu search (GTS) heuristic. At the end of each global iteration, information about the edges most often used is recorded to be used in the following phases. The method is evaluated on three sets of randomly generated instances and compared with other heuristics and a lower bound.

The aim of this problem is to determine optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles that can renew their capacity at intermediate replenishment stations. Although this problem is often met in real-life scenarios of transportation logistics, it has not received much attention by researchers. Our proposed framework employs a combination of algorithmic blocks based on powerful metaheuristic methodologies designed to achieve a desirable intensification and diversification interplay. In the first step of the solution approach, the initial solution is obtained by a cost-saving construction heuristic. In the second step, the initial solution is improved by employing tabu search within the variable neighborhood search methodology. Finally, guided local search is applied in the third step, to eliminate low-quality features from the final solution produced. The proposed algorithmic framework was successfully applied to benchmark instances in the literature, generating several new best solutions. To motivate the proposed algorithmic choices and test the robustness of the algorithm, we also developed new classes of VRPIRF benchmark instances with diverse problem characteristics. © 2008 INFORMS.","Guided local search; Replenishment facilities; Tabu search; Vehicle routing; VNS"

Every vehicle's travel miles (route time) after charging is limited, thus the vehicle must be recharged after taking several trips and the minimal charging time (fueling time) must be satisfied. A multiple ant colony algorithm (ACA) was presented to solve VSPRFTC based on ACA used to solve traveling salesman problem (TSP), a new metaheuristic approach inspired by the foraging behavior of real colonies of ants. The VSPRFTC considered in this paper minimizes a multiple, hierarchical objective function: the first objective is to minimize the number of tours (or vehicles) and the second is to minimize the total deadhead time. New improvement of ACA as well as detailed operating steps was provided on the basis of former algorithm. Then in order to settle contradiction between accelerating convergence and avoiding prematurity or stagnation, improvement on route construction rule and Pheromone updating rule was adopted. A group feasible trip sets (blocks) had been produced after the process of applying ACA. In dealing with the fueling time constraint a bipartite graphic model and its optimization algorithm are developed for trip set connecting in a hub and spoke network system to minimize the number of vehicle required. The maximum matching of the bipartite graph is obtained by calculating the maximum inflow with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. At last, an example was analyzed to demonstrate the correctness of the application of this algorithm. It proved to be more efficient and robust in solving this problem. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The numerous applications of the problem includes, namely, movement of industrial goods along a supply chain, courier services, public transport, urban solid waste collection and mobile caterers. Each problem has its own peculiar restrictions that may pertain to vehicle capacity, collection and/or delivery, asymmetric distances and specific time windows. The advent of computers and networking has increased the challenge in the task of a logistics manager who has to take several decisions in a short span of time. The availability of quick and efficient solutions through algorithms or heuristics embedded in the decision-maker's computer will cut down logistics costs in today's competitive environment.

All problem variants are transformed into a rich pickup and delivery model and solved using the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) framework presented in Ropke and Pisinger [An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows.

The ALNS framework is an extension of the large neighborhood search framework by Shaw [Using constraint programming and local search methods to solve vehicle routing problems.

This layer adaptively chooses among a number of insertion and removal heuristics to intensify and diversify the search. The presented approach has a number of advantages: it provides solutions of very high quality, the algorithm is robust, and to some extent self-calibrating. Moreover, the unified model allows the dispatcher to mix various variants of VRP problems for individual customers or vehicles. As we believe that the ALNS framework can be applied to a large number of tightly constrained optimization problems, a general description of the framework is given, and it is discussed how the various components can be designed in a particular setting. The paper is concluded with a computational study, in which the five different variants of the vehicle routing problem are considered on standard benchmark tests from the literature. The outcome of the tests is promising as the algorithm is able to improve 183 best known solutions out of 486 benchmark tests.

One of the most important aspects in collection of plant fresh products, is routing of collecting vehicles, so that total collection time is minimized.

Our effort focuses on developing an innovative method, which produces reliable and high quality solutions, requiring reasonable computing effort. The main innovation of the algorithm, toward a typical threshold accepting algorithm, is that during the optimization process the value of the threshold is not only lowered, but also raised or back-tracked according to how effective a local search is. This adaptation of the value of the threshold, plays an important role in finding high quality routing solutions.
