In real environment, we can find situations involving a very large number of clients or constraints which indicate that exact methods should be avoided. In this context, this paper presents two metaheuristcs which are used to solve a complex problem named the Heterogeneous Site-Dependent Multi-depot Multi-trip Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (HSDMDMTPVRP). The HSDMDMTPVRP is a real problem found in the automotive industry and considers several well-known Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). The first metaheuristic is an adaptation of the Unified Hybrid Genetic Search (UHGS) which considers an advanced diversity control, feasibility control and a restart mechanism. The second one is a new metaheuristic named Adaptive Variable Neighborhood Race (AVNR) which combines variable neighborhood search and adaptive mechanisms integrated with a shrinking population managed with a diversity mechanism. Both approaches are also used for solving some variants of the VRP: Heterogeneous VRP, Site dependent VRP, Periodic VRP and Multi-trip VRP. Our computational experiments used 398 available instances in the literature with generic code path and also present 20 new instances for the HSDMDMTPVRP. The metaheuristics solved all instances with only one set of parameters and the results outperform or present the same solutions found by several state-of-the-art algorithms, showing the good performance of the approaches. Out of the 398 previously tested literature instances, the proposed metaheuristics found 140 new best-known solutions and 209 of the best-known ones. For the remaining instances, both approaches found results very close to best ones known.","2023-05","2024-04-22 16:47:59","2024-04-22 16:47:59","","","","","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000947448800001","","","","","","","Metaheuristics; Vehicle Routing Problem; FLEET FORMULATION; Heterogeneous VRP; LOCAL SEARCH; MEMETIC ALGORITHM; Multi-depot VRP; Multi-trips VRP; Periodic VRP; Site dependent VRP; SIZE; TABU SEARCH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors are the winners of second and third places, combined with members of the challenge organizing committee. The problem central to the challenge was a rich VRP: expensive and, therefore, scarce equipment was to be redistributed over customer locations within time windows. The difficulty was in creating combinations of pickups and deliveries that reduce the amount of equipment needed to execute the schedule, as well as the lengths of the routes and the number of vehicles used. This paper gives a description of the solution methods of the above-mentioned participants. The second place method involves sequences of 22 low level heuristics: each of these heuristics is associated with a transition probability to move to another low level heuristic. A randomly drawn sequence of these heuristics is applied to an initial solution, after which the probabilities are updated depending on whether or not this sequence improved the objective value, hence increasing the chance of selecting the sequences that generate improved solutions. The third place method decomposes the problem into two independent parts: first, it schedules the delivery days for all requests using a genetic algorithm. Each schedule in the genetic algorithm is evaluated by estimating its cost using a deterministic routing algorithm that constructs feasible routes for each day. After spending 80 percent of time in this phase, the last 20 percent of the computation time is spent on Variable Neighborhood Descent to further improve the routes found by the deterministic routing algorithm. This article finishes with an in-depth comparison of the results of the two approaches.","2019-12","2024-04-22 16:48:00","2024-04-22 16:48:00","","561-595","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000504189300005","","","","","","","Routing; Metaheuristics; VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; A-RIDE PROBLEM; Evolutionary computations; HYPER-HEURISTICS; Inventory; PICK-UP; SELECTION; SIMULTANEOUS DELIVERY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some perishable products such as foods and medicine require a special treatment during delivery due to their limited lifetime, and all perishable products must be transported as quickly as possible before they spoil. In addition to the time limitation on transport, high frequency of transportation may lead to high transportation cost, making the optimization of transportation cost for delivering perishable products very important in this industry. In addition, high frequency of transportation may also contribute to air pollution. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a green vehicle routing problem (VRP) for perishable products which optimizes the operational cost, deterioration cost, carbon emissions and customer satisfaction. The proposed VRP model also considers time windows, different travelling time during peak hour and off-peak hour, and working hours. This paper solves the proposed model using a many-objective gradient evolution (MOGE) algorithm. GE algorithm is a new metaheuristic which was originally proposed for continuous problems with a single objective. However, this study improves the original GE algorithm with discretization, non-dominated sorting, and crowding distance approaches. The proposed model and algorithm are employed to solve a fruit distribution problem. The experiment results show that the proposed MOGE algorithm has more promising results than other algorithms.

The implementation of these algorithms plays a crucial role in achieving favorable outcomes with the available resources. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been a central topic in distribution and logistics for decades. New VRP models and tools are developed to address the challenges of modern logistics. The Energy Minimizing Vehicle Routing Problem (EMVRP) is a ""green""-oriented variant of the VRP where the objective is to minimize the total amount of energy consumed by a fleet of vehicles. The VRP literature has focused on solving the problem using a variety of approaches and techniques, including exact methods, heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid algorithms. Hybrid algorithms combine different techniques to obtain more effective and better solutions. This work presents four innovative hybrid algorithms to address the EMVRP problem. These algorithms combine Machine Learning (ML) clustering techniques with metaheuristic approaches inspired by an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed algorithms are: Free Ant + K-Means, Free Ant + K-Medoids, Restricted Ant + K-Means, and Restricted Ant + K-Medoids. Each of them combines the benefits of clustering with the optimization capacity of ACO. Proposed algorithms were subjected to testing using instances from CVRPLIB. Both Free Ant and Restricted Ant efficiently solved EMVRP problems. The results obtained were analyzed and compared with the proposals of other authors in the literature. Overall, the results are promising, but they also indicate a significant scope for experimentation and parameter tuning of the proposed algorithms.","2023","2024-04-22 16:48:00","2024-04-22 16:48:00","","125800-125821","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001104697100001","","","","","","","machine learning; metaheuristics; Complex problems; free ant; green-vrp; heuristics; k-means; k-medoids; restricted ant; vehicle routing problem (VRP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, as collaborations in logistics between several companies become popular, more flexible and extended models must be solved to consider the different needs of the companies. This is of high importance in a new logistics concept, the Physical Internet, which is expected to considerably improve the way logistics are handled in the current supply chain management. To optimise the aforementioned requirements, a rich vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery including numerous attributes is modelled and solved. A mathematical formulation is proposed and implemented in CPLEX to solve the problem. Given the complexity of the problem, solving large instances with exact methods is very time-consuming. Therefore, a multi-threaded meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing is developed. A set of new operators coupled with a restart strategy and memory are developed to help improve the performance. Computational results on a generated data-set showed that the proposed meta-heuristic is superior to the CPLEX solver in terms of solvability and computational time. The proposed metaheuristic was also compared with the best-known results by current state-of-the-art methods on a classical benchmark on pickup and delivery problems with time windows (with up to 200 customers).

One of the most important variations within this problem is called Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP), in which environmental aspects are considered when designing product delivery routes. This variant arises due to the high levels of pollution produced by transport vehicles, so it is a variation whose study represents a vital impact nowadays. This project will consider a GVRP and will be developed considering the characteristics of multi-depot (MDVRP) and multi-product (MPVRP) to minimize the costs of assignation of vehicles and CO2 emissions. To solve the problem, this project proposes a hybridization between the classic tabu search (TS) metaheuristic and the PAES algorithm (TS+PAES) to generate the Pareto frontier of both objectives. An integer mixed linear programming model is formulated and developed for each objective function separately to have an optimal point of comparison for the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Also, the TS+PAES algorithm is compared to the nearest neighbor algorithm for large instances. Two computational experiments were carried out, one for small and the other one for large instances. The experiment for small instances showed that the GAP of each extreme of the frontier compared to the MILP model is on average 0.73%. For large instances, the metaheuristic improves in 0.1% the results presented by the MILP model showing that the metaheuristic provides closer near-optimal solutions in less computational time. Besides, the metaheuristic, in comparison with the nearest neighborhood heuristic, improves in 44.21% the results of emissions and in 3.88% the costs.

In this paper, an attempt is made to work with various new optimization techniques for minimizing the detrimental effect of EV charging station (EVCS) load on the electrical network. The operating conditions of the distribution network, that is, voltage stability, reliability and power loss (VRP) index are optimized in this work in a framework of multiple objectives with various technical constraints. Although many optimization approaches have been developed in recent years, eight well-known techniques are employed in the present work such as modified teaching-learner-based optimization (MTLBO), JAYA, modified JAYA (MJAYA), ant-lion optimization (ALO), whale optimization technique (WOT), grasshopper optimization technique (GOT), modified whale optimization algorithm (MWOA), and hybrid whale particle swarm optimization (HWPSOA). All the eight techniques' performance is compared under two different cases of operations by testing the objective function on the modified IEEE 33 bus distribution system using MATLAB software. The numerical solutions obtained by the HWPSOA indicate the suitability and effectiveness for optimizing the specified complex multi-objective function compared to other techniques.","2023-09-14","2024-04-22 16:48:00","2024-04-22 16:48:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001069909300001","","","","","","","optimization; OPTIMIZATION; electric vehicle charging station; metaheuristic techniques; renewable energy sources; VRP index; WIND TURBINES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many exact, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed to solve VRP. An important variant of the VRP arises when a FLeet of vehicles is fixed and characterised by different capacities for distribution activities. The problem is known as the heterogeneous fixed fleet VRP (HFFVRP). The HFFVRP is a natural generalisation of the VRP with several vehicle types, each type being defined by a capacity, a fixed cost and a cost per distance unit, and can cover more practical situations in transportation. This problem consists of determining a set of vehicle trips of minimum total length in which a set of customers is to be satisfied in the demand constraints using identical vehicles with limited capacity. If open routes instead of closed ones are considered in the HFFVRP, the problem becomes a heterogeneous fixed fleet Open VRP (HFFOVRP) which has numerous applications in industrial and service problems. In this paper, a bone route algorithm which uses the tabu search as an improved procedure is utilised to solve the HFFOVRP. The proposed algorithm was tested empirically on a 24 of generated VRPs, and compared with elite ant system and ant colony system. In all cases, the proposed algorithm finds the best-known solutions within a reasonable time.","2014-05-03","2024-04-22 16:48:01","2024-04-22 16:48:01","","2565-2575","","9","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000334051300005","","","","","","","HEURISTIC ALGORITHM; tabu search; TABU SEARCH ALGORITHM; DEPOT; bone route; heterogeneous fixed fleet; nearest neighbourhood insertion; open vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective is to minimize operational and environmental costs while respecting capacity constraints and service time windows. Costs are based on driver wages and fuel consumption, which depends on many factors, such as travel distance and vehicle load. The vehicle speeds are considered as decision variables.

VRP has a vast range of application fields such as transportation, logistics, manufacturing, relief systems and communication. To suit the needs of different real-world VRP scenarios, many models of VRP have been developed - CVRP (Capacitated VRP) being the classical form. In this article, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, ICAHGS, is proposed for solving CVRP. The present study proposes a refined Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) as the primary evolutionary and multipopulation method for addressing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). In order to further optimize the search process, a Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS-CVRP) algorithm is applied as an enhanced local search and population management strategy within the ICA framework. Additionally, the internal restart step of the HGS-CVRP algorithm is replaced with a multi-step restart mechanism for intensification improvement. One notable aspect of the proposed method is its ability to facilitate parallel processing, with each empire able to be processed on a separate processor. This structure allows for increased computational efficiency in addressing the CVRP. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it has been compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The results of this comparison, which include both classical benchmark instances and real-world applications, demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples' lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center.

The focal point of distribution logistics is the shipment of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer. The products can be delivered to a customer directly either from the production facility or from the trader's stock located close to the production site or, probably, via additional regional distribution warehouses. These kinds of distribution logistics are mathematically represented as a vehicle routing problem (VRP), a well-known nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem of operations research. VRP is more suited for applications having one warehouse. In reality, however, many companies and industries possess more than one distribution warehouse. These kinds of problems can be solved with an extension of VRP called multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). MDVRP is an NP-hard and combinatorial optimization problem. MDVRP is an important and challenging problem in logistics management. It can be solved using a search algorithm or metaheuristic and can be viewed as searching for the best element in a set of discrete items. In this article, cluster first and route second methodology is adapted and metaheuristics genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to solve MDVRP. A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) for solving MDVRP is also proposed. In HPSO, the initial particles are generated based on the k-means clustering and nearest neighbor heuristic (NNH). The particles are decoded into clusters and multiple routes are generated within the clusters. The 2-opt local search heuristic is used for optimizing the routes obtained; then the results are compared with GA and PSO for randomly generated problem instances.

Researchers are becoming progressively concerned about the destruction it is producing to the environment, and EVs are identified to play a part in equalizing the balance. In the Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CE-VRP), the vehicles have a limited delivery capacity and rely completely on their limited battery capacity. Besides, all vehicle has a limited driving range and must recharge their battery at some customer's locations. In this paper, a ""Hybrid Variable Neighbourhood Search (HVNS)"" is proposed to solve the CE-VRP. The results provide indications on the ideal size of the fleet, and on the total distance traveled while minimizing the associated costs.

Moreover, the distribution activities have a non-negligible impact on the environment, as well as on the citizens' welfare. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) aims at designing routes that minimize the cost of serving customers using a given set of capacitated vehicles. Some VRP variants consider traveling times, either in the objective function (e.g., including the goal of minimizing total traveling time or designing balanced routes) or as constraints (e.g., the setting of time windows or a maximum time per route). Typically, the traveling time between two customers or between one customer and the depot is assumed to be both known in advance and static. However, in real life, there are plenty of factors (predictable or not) that may affect these traveling times, e.g., traffic jams, accidents, road works, or even the weather. In this work, we analyze the VRP with dynamic traveling times. Our work assumes not only that these inputs are dynamic in nature, but also that they are a function of the structure of the emerging routing plan. In other words, these traveling times need to be dynamically re-evaluated as the solution is being constructed. In order to solve this dynamic optimization problem, a learnheuristic-based approach is proposed. Our approach integrates statistical learning techniques within a metaheuristic framework. A number of computational experiments are carried out in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness.","2018-12","2024-04-22 16:49:32","2024-04-22 16:49:32","","","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000454716100019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these techniques, metaheuristic algorithms that can perform random search are the most promising because they can be used to find the right solution in the shortest possible time. Therefore, in this paper, the Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm was used to attempt to solve the VRP. The algorithm was applied to 10 scenarios and the experimental results revealed that the HHO had a strong ability to check for and find the best route as compared to other metaheuristic algorithms, namely, simulated annealing and artificial bee colony optimization.

Nowadays, generalizations of VRP have been developed for tactical or strategic decision levels of companies but not both. The tactical extension or periodic VRP (PVRP) plans a set of trips over a multiperiod horizon, subject to frequency constraints. The strategic extension is motivated by interdependent depot location and routing decisions in most distribution systems. Low-quality solutions are obtained if depots are located first, regardless of the future routes. In the location-routing problem (LRP), location and routing decisions are tackled simultaneously. Here for the first time, except for some conference papers, the goal is to combine the PVRP and LRP into an even more realistic problem covering all decision levels: the periodic LRP or PLRP. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve large size instances of the PLRP. First, an individual representing an assignment of customers to combinations of visit days is randomly generated. The evolution operates through an Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) on visit day assignments. The algorithm is hybridized with a heuristic based on the Randomized Extended Clarke and Wright Algorithm (RECWA) to create feasible solutions and stops when a given number of iterations is reached. The method is evaluated over three sets of instances, and solutions are compared to the literature on particular cases such as one-day horizon (LRP) or one depot (PVRP). This metaheuristic outperforms the previous methods for the PLRP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we extend current E-VRP models to consider nonlinear charging functions. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed for this problem. To assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions, we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature.

In particular, local search-based metaheuristics have been successfully applied to the capacitated VRP (CVRP). The CVRP aims at defining the minimum cost delivery routes for a given set of identical vehicles since each vehicle only travels one route and there is a single (central) depot. The best metaheuristics to the CVRP avoid getting stuck in local optima by embedding specific hill-climbing mechanisms such as diversification strategies into the solution methods. This paper introduces a hybridization of a novel adaptive version of Iterated Local Search with PathRelinking (AILS-PR) to the CVRP. The major contribution of this paper is an automatic mechanism to control the diversity step of the metaheuristic to allow it to escape from local optima. The results of experiments with 100 benchmark CVPR instances show that AILS-PR outperformed the state-of-the-art CVRP metaheuristics. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In specific, it presents a strategy for reducing the computational complexity required for applying local search to tackle various combinatorial optimization problems. The value of this contribution is two-fold. It helps practitioners design efficient local search implementations, and it facilitates the application of robust commercial local search-based algorithms to practical instances of very large size. The central rationale underlying the proposed complexity reduction strategy is straightforward: when a local search operator is applied to a given solution, only a limited part of this solution is modified. Thus, to exhaustively examine the neighborhood of the new solution, only the tentative moves that refer to the modified solution part have to be evaluated. To reduce the complexity of neighborhood evaluation, the static move descriptor (SMD) data structures are introduced, which encode local search moves in a systematic and solution independent manner. The proposed strategy is applied to the vehicle routing problem (VRP) which is of high importance both from the practical and theoretical viewpoints. The use of the SMD concept, for encoding three commonly applied quadratic local search operators, results into a VRP local search method which exhibits an almost linearithmic complexity in respect to the instance size. Furthermore. exploiting the SMD representation of tentative moves, a metaheuristic strategy is proposed, which is aimed at diversifying the conducted search via a simple penalization policy. The proposed metaheuristic was tested on various large and very large scale VRP benchmark instances. It produced fine results, and managed to improve several best known solutions. The method was also executed on real-world instances of 3000 customers, the data of which reflects the actual geographic distribution of customers within four major cities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem leads to ensure giving specific cares to people in need either in illness or disability in their own homes. Home Health Care (HHC) proposes this kind of services for patients demanding it. These services have to be done at the request of the patient which appears to be the client in a way that gives satisfaction to the requester of the service. Often, these demands are bound by a specific time that the workforce (caregivers) are obligated to respect in addition to the precedence (priority) constraint. The main purpose of the HHC structures is to provide a service that is good in term of quality, minimize the overall costs and shorten the losses. To reduce the costs of these HHC structures, it is mandatory to find comprehensible and logical ways to do it, for it is not permissible to touch the caregiver salary, HHC structures find themselves in the obligation to optimize by other means such as reducing the travel cost. Note that these structures give cares in one's home, which means that the travel aspect is important and is considered the core spending charges of the institution. Another fact is the satisfaction of the patients toward caregivers; this is an essential element to optimize in order to obtain a good quality service, to give a realistic aspect for the problem the lunch break of caregivers is introduced as a parameter. For those arguments, a conception of an efficient planning of caregivers involves using decision tools and optimization methods. A caregiver (vehicle) is attributed to a patient (customer) to do a number of cares with several options in accordance to the customer wishes like time windows requirement often specified by the client, the priority or precedence constraints are usually performed if a care have to be performed before another and could need the intervention of more than one caregiver and must have at least one lunch break a day and it is not always taken at a set time of the day and must be versatile to optimize customer demand satisfaction.

This paper discusses the use of biological intelligence in analysis and optimization on MDVRP-TW. The objective of the MDVRP-TW is to minimize the overall distance, means of transportation within a specified time gap, along with other constraints such as limitation of vehicle capacity, restrictions of route duration length to satisfy the customer's requirements. The routes must be designed where each customer is visited only once in a particular time gap with one vehicle and all the routes must originate and end at the same depot. The overall demand should not go beyond the vehicle's capacity on each route. Multi-objective problems have attracted the attentions of many researchers in recent years, as they are more closely related to real-world situations. However, transportation is a significant factor for the current society, exhibiting and planning a complicated transport system was a very thought-provoking task. Many research studies have shown several successful metaheuristics and heuristic methodologies to solve MDVRP-TW in which, instead of a single depot, numerous depots with varying locations. In this work considered both the earliest time and latest arrival time window (double-sided time window). It is assumed that if an arrival time is more significant than the latest time, it will lead to an infeasible solution whereas, if an arrival time is lesser than the earliest time, then it will lead to a waiting time. However, due to its challenging task and multi-objective and limitations, there is still a space to solve it. In this work, a novel technique that combines an improved firefly algorithm (IFA), which uses different mechanisms, namely, inter-depot approach in assignment phase, Clarke & wright algorithm, and local search method in routing and scheduling phase were applied. The suggested technique has been evaluated using Cordeau standard benchmark instances and proved the technique's novelty and feasibility.

Horizontal cooperation (HC) concepts represent a promising strategy to increase the performance of supply chains. HC is based on sharing resources and making joint decisions among different agents at the same level of the supply chain. This paper analyzes different cooperation scenarios concerning integrated routing and facility-location decisions in road transportation: (a) a noncooperative scenario in which all decisions are individually taken (each enterprise addresses its own vehicle routing problem [VRP]); (b) a semicooperative scenario in which route-planning decisions are jointly taken (facilities and fleets are shared and enterprises face a joint multidepot VRP); and (c) a fully cooperative scenario in which route-planning and facility-location decisions are jointly taken (also customers are shared, and thus enterprises face a general location routing problem). Our analysis explores how this increasing level of HC leads to a higher flexibility and, therefore, to a lower total distribution cost. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, combining biased randomization with a variable neighborhood search framework, is proposed to solve each scenario. This allows us to quantify the differences among these scenarios, both in terms of monetary and environmental costs. Our solving approach is tested on a range of benchmark instances, outperforming previously reported results.","2019-03","2024-04-22 16:49:32","2024-04-22 16:49:32","","551-576","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000449867500008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Every e-commerce application offers the convenience and choices needed by the community. The Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) model has been widely developed in recent years. 2E-VRP makes it possible for customers to combine shipments from several different stores due to satellites in their distribution stream. The aim of this paper is to optimize a two-echelon logistics distribution network for package delivery on e-commerce platforms, where vans operate in the first echelon and motorcycles operate in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as 2E-VRP, where total travel costs and fuel consumption are minimized. This optimization is based on determining the flow in each echelon and choosing the optimal routing solution for vans and motorcycles. Methods: This paper proposes a combination of the K-means Clustering Algorithm and the 2-opt Algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Many previous studies have used the K-means algorithm to help streamline the search for solutions. In the solution series, clustering is carried out between the satellite and the customer in the first echelon using the K-means algorithm. To determine the optimal k-cluster, we analyzed it using the silhouette, gap statistic, and elbow methods. Furthermore, the routing at each echelon is solved by the 2-opt heuristic method. At the end of the article, we present testing of several instances with the different number of clusters. The study results indicate an influence on the determination of the number of clusters in minimizing the objective function. Results: This paper looks at 100 customers, 10 satellites, and 1 depot. By working in two stages, the first stage is the resolution of satellite and customer problems, and the second stage is the resolution of problems between the satellite and the depots. We compare distance and cost solutions with a different number of k-clusters. From the test results, the number of k-clusters shows an effect of number and distance on the solution. Conclusions: In the 2E-VRP model, determining the location of the cluster between the satellite and the customer is very important in preparing the delivery schedule in logistics distribution within the city. The benefit is that the vehicle can divide the destination according to the location characteristics of the satellite and the customer, although setting the how many clusters do not guarantee obtaining the optimal distance. And the test results also show that the more satellites there are, the higher the shipping costs. For further research, we will try to complete the model with the metaheuristic genetic algorithm method and compare it with the 2-opt heuristic method.","2022","2024-04-22 16:49:32","2024-04-22 16:49:32","","213-225","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000822705100006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They combine multiple attributes, which constitute a complement to the traditional models. This work proposes an adaptive solution method based on metaheuristics for solving a Rich Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. This software has been embedded into the fleet management system of a company in the Canary Islands. The attributes considered by the company are a fixed heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, soft and multiple time windows, customer priorities and vehicle-customer constraints. Furthermore, the company requires the consideration of several objective functions that include travelled distance and time/distance balance. Exact algorithms are not applicable when solving real-life large VRP instances. This work presents a General Variable Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic, which obtains high quality solutions. The computational experiments are presented in four sections, which comprise the parameter setting, the analysis of the effect of the considered attributes, the comparative with the literature for the standard VRP with Time Windows, and the study of the solutions provided by the algorithm when compared with the solutions implemented by the company.

In most VRP types, route cost is associated with distance, and a shorter distance solution is considered a more successful solution. While the shortest distance goal provides significant advantages in terms of cost and time to businesses, this makes it attractive for further research. When examining the types of problems having different directions and areas devised from different points of view on vehicle routing, it can be said that the closest approach to practical application is the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (VRPSDP). In this study, a solution proposal is presented for the VRPSDP using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the application is tested with the benchmark problem data sets commonly used for VRPSDP in the literature. When the results are compared with the least cost route solutions in the literature, it is observed that despite the few parameters, the proposed method can produce low-cost solutions very close to the most successful solutions in the literature.

From a depot with identical vehicles of limited capacity, it consists in determining a set of vehicle trips of minimum total length, to satisfy the demands of a set of customers. in general, the number of vehicles used is a decision variable. The heterogeneous fleet VRP (HFVRP or HVRP) is a natural generalization with several vehicle types, each type being defined by a capacity, a fixed cost, a cost per distance unit and a number of vehicles available. The vehicle fleet mix problem (VFMP) is a variant with an unlimited number of vehicles per type. This paper presents two memetic algorithms (genetic algorithms hybridized with a local search) able to solve both the VFMP and the HVRP. They are based on chromosomes encoded as giant tours, without trip delimiters, and on an optimal evaluation procedure which splits these tours into feasible trips and assigns vehicles to them. The second algorithm uses a distance measure in solution space to diversify the search. Numerical tests on standard VFMP and HFVRP instances show that the two methods, especially the one with distance measure, compete with published metaheuristics and improve several best-known solutions.

A specific index is used for quantifying the exposure of a vehicle to the risk of being robbed along its route. In addition, the problem is subject to a traditional capacity constraint, which limits the maximum amount of valuables that can be transported inside the vehicle. This constraint might be imposed, for example, by insurance companies. A biobjective formulation, aimed at reducing both risk and travel costs, is proposed. The objectives are conflicting since higher risk exposures would allow a reduction of the travel costs incurred by a transportation firm to visit all its customers for the collection of cash. A mathematical model of the problem is described and solved using a progressive multiobjective metaheuristic. Multiobjective optimization and multicriteria decision making are integrated into a single metaheuristic algorithm. To simplify the decision process, the decision maker's preferences are embedded into the multiobjective algorithm. Realistic instances are generated considering the geographical coordinates of several customers (e.g., stores, banks, shopping centers) located in Belgium. The proposed solution approach is tuned and tested both on these realistic instances and standard benchmark instances for the capacitated VRP.","2017-01","2024-04-22 16:49:32","2024-04-22 16:49:32","","59-76","","1-2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000384672600005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The VRPSPD can arise in many transportation systems involving both distribution and collection operations. Originally, the VRPSPD assumes a homogeneous fleet of vehicles to serve the customers. However, in many practical situations, there are different types of vehicles available to perform the pickup and delivery operations. In this study, the original version of the VRPSPD is extended by assuming the fleet of vehicles to be heterogeneous. The Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD) is considered to be an NP-hard problem because it generalizes the classical VRP. For its solution, we develop a hybrid focal search algorithm in which a non-monotone threshold adjusting strategy is integrated with tabu search. The threshold function used in the algorithm has an adaptive nature which makes it self-tuning. Additionally, its implementation is very simple as it requires no parameter tuning except for the tabu list length. The proposed algorithm is applied to a set of randomly generated problem instances. The results indicate that the developed approach can produce efficient and effective solutions. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A mixed-integer non-linear programming model (MINLP) is presented to address the integrated VRP and M/M/C queueing system. The suggested model makes decisions about optimal routing, delivery time interval to customers, number of servers in traditional retailers, inventory replenishment policies, and retailers' price. For the first time, this model considers two retailing channels simultaneously under different uncertainty, including demand, delivery lead time, service time, and delivery time interval to customers.

Because the number of variables and equations is vast, finding the exact solution for this problem under real conditions is difficult; only heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms can be used to solve it. Recently, the ejection chain method (ECM) has been introduced as a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds a new neighbor solution. In a case study in developing countries, efficiency of several heuristic algorithms including ECM along with one metaheuristic algorithm-tabu search algorithm (TSA)-is verified for solving large-scale problems. Additionally, capacity limitation, which is usually ignored in VRP and SBRP algorithms such as ECM, is considered as a restricting condition in this study's models. This study will show that neither the ECM used individually nor its combination with TSA produces feasible solutions for real-life scenarios. The authors have developed two innovative heuristic algorithms, the construction feasible solutions and the changing algorithm, that-when used in combination with TSA and ECM-generate a practical and efficient procedure called the mixed algorithm (MA). Addressing vehicles' capacity is mainly performed by the construction of feasible solutions (solutions satisfying capacity limitations as well) from the infeasible solutions that might result from the TSA and ECM. The changing algorithm is responsible for generating a local optimum for every resulting feasible solution. Data from bus routing of a middle school were used to show the effectiveness of the MA.","2009","2024-04-22 16:49:32","2024-04-22 16:49:32","","140-147","","2137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000274589500016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, many researchers have realized the importance of green logistic system design in decreasing environmental pollution and achieving sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is developed for the capacitated electric VRP with time windows and partial recharge. The first objective deals with minimizing the route to reduce the costs related to vehicles, while the second objective minimizes the delay of arrival vehicles to depots based on the soft time window. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm including non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO), called NSGA-II-TLBO, is proposed for solving this problem. The Taguchi method is used to adjust the parameters of algorithms. Several numerical instances in different sizes are solved and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to NSGA-II and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) as two well-known algorithms based on the five indexes including time, mean ideal distance (MID), diversity, spacing and the Rate of Achievement to two objectives Simultaneously (RAS). Findings - The results demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm outperforms terms of spacing and RAS indexes with p-value <0.04. However, MOSA and NSGA-II algorithms have better performance in terms of central processing unit (CPU) time index. In addition, there is no meaningful difference between the algorithms in terms of MID and diversity indexes.

DARP has been used in many modern applications, including the scheduling of demand-responsive transit and car pooling. This study departs from the original definition of DARP and it extends it by considering an interchange point where vehicles can exchange their picked-up passengers with other vehicles in order to shorten their delivery routes and reduce their running times. In addition to that, this study introduces the concept of generalized passenger travel times in the DARP formulation which translates the increased in vehicle crowdedness to increased perceived passenger travel times. This addresses a key issue because the perceived in-vehicle travel times of passengers might increase when the vehicle becomes more crowded (i.e., passengers might feel that their travel time is higher when they are not able to find a seat or they are too close to each other increasing the risk of virus transmission or accidents). Given these considerations, this study introduces the Dial-a-Ride Problem with interchange and perceived travel times (DARPi) and models it as a nonlinear programming problem. DARPi is then reformulated to a MILP with the use of linearizations and its search space is tightened with the addition of valid inequalities that are employed when solving the problem to global optimality with Branch-and-Cut. For large problem instances, this study introduces a tabu search-based metaheuristic and performs experiments in benchmark instances used in past literature demonstrating the computation times and solution stability of our approach. The effect of the perceived passenger travel times to the vehicle running costs is also explored in extensive numerical experiments.","2023-11","2024-04-22 16:49:33","2024-04-22 16:49:33","","","","","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001081774900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the present paper attempts to offer a combined model of vehicle routing, location and supplier selection problems with more compatibility with the real-world problems. Moreover, the proposed model will attempt to reduce the fuel consumption rate (FCR) of vehicles and pollutant emissions simultaneously. Because the problem is NP-hard, meta-heuristic algorithms including simulated annealing (SA), Tabu search algorithm (TS), bat algorithm (BA) and variable neighborhood search algorithm based on simulated annealing (VNS-SA) are used for solving the large dimensions of the problem. For smaller dimensions of the problem, several numerical examples are generated and solved by GAMS Software and meta-heuristic algorithms of SA, TS, BA, and VNS-SA.

Inner-city center deliveries are performed by small vehicles due to access restrictions, while deliveries outside this area are carried out by conventional vehicles for economic reasons. Goods are transferred from the first to the second echelon by synchronized meetings between vehicles of the respective echelons. We investigate the assignment of customers to vehicles, i.e., to the first or second echelon, within a so-called 'grey zone' on the border of the inner city and the area around it. While doing this, the economic objective as well as negative external effects of transport, such as emissions and disturbance (negative impact on citizens due to noise and congestion), are taken into account to include objectives of companies as well as of citizens and municipal authorities. Our metaheuristic - a large neighborhood search embedded in a heuristic rectangle/cuboid splitting - addresses this problem efficiently. We investigate the impact of the free assignment of part of the customers ('grey zone') to echelons and of three different city layouts on the solution. Computational results show that the impact of a 'grey zone' and thus the assignment of these customers to echelons depend significantly on the layout of a city. Potentially pareto-optimal solutions for two and three objectives are illustrated to efficiently support decision makers in sustainable city logistics planning processes. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this problem, trucks and motorcycles have left the depot and served customers. After running out of inventory, at the joint nodes with the trucks, the motorcycles have been reloaded as many as the customers need and finally, returned to the depot. After modeling this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model, a particle swarm optimization algorithm, as well as a hybrid of particle swarm optimization-simulated annealing (PSO-SA) algorithm, is also proposed. The PSO-SA algorithm employs both PSO and SA sequentially and combines the advantages of PSO's good exploration capability and SA's good local search properties. Extensive comparisons have been made to evaluate the performance of the mathematical model and the proposed algorithms using two data groups. The results of small-size instances showed that the outputs of the PSO and PSO-SA algorithms are close to the outputs of the GAMS. Furthermore, these algorithms compared to the ant colony optimization (ACO) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithms in terms of objective function value and runtime have satisfactory results for both data groups. In large-size instances, after tuning the parameters of the hybrid algorithm with the Taguchi method, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the PSO, ACO and VNS algorithms. The results and statistical analysis show that the PSO and VNS algorithms have better performance compared to the PSO-SA and ACO algorithms in terms of solution quality. Also, according to the average runtime, the performance of the algorithm PSO-SA is more efficient than that of other algorithms. In general, it can be concluded that the hybrid algorithm has better performance with respect to both time and solution quality criteria.","2022-05","2024-04-22 16:49:33","2024-04-22 16:49:33","","","","","141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000762974200013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One particularly challenging distribution operation is the transportation of fresh -cut flowers. This process demands that a required quality be maintained at every stage, spanning from the flower growers, wholesalers, and retailers to the end customer. Failure to uphold the required level of freshness can lead to adverse outcomes such as decreased profits, customer attrition, and a tarnished reputation. To investigate this complex distribution process, fresh flower distribution was studied using data from a reputed floral company in Sri Lanka with the aim of finding the optimal set of routes for the distribution of fresh -cut flowers. Methods: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants were employed and the 'Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Perishable Goods with Single Depot' (CVRPTWfPGSD) was introduced. A hybrid method combining both heuristics and metaheuristics was selected as the methodology by considering several factors such as complexity, solution type, and execution time. The initial solution construction phase adopted the Path Cheapest Arc (PCA) heuristic. To further improve solution quality, the Guided Local Search (GLS) metaheuristic was applied. Results: This CVRPTWfPGSD model is validated for real -world scenarios, as it does not violate the maximum allowable perishability time provided for each vehicle. Three experiments were conducted by varying the vehicle fleet to measure the applicability of the model under different circumstances to decide on a better vehicle combination while minimizing total distribution time. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the composition of the vehicle fleet has a substantial influence on freshness levels and distribution times. Conclusions: Optimizing the distribution of fresh -cut flowers using VRP assists in reducing spoilage and waste by ensuring that flowers are transported under the best possible conditions. The application of this model holds immense value for floral companies as it offers assistance when planning their distribution network. Specifically, it can assist in identifying optimal routes that maximize freshness with minimum distribution time and an optimal set of vehicles.","2024","2024-04-22 16:49:33","2024-04-22 16:49:33","","23-37","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001197245000005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last 50 years a number of different formulations have been proposed, together with an even greater number of algorithms for the solution of the problem. In this paper, the VRP is formulated as a problem of two decision levels. In the first level, the decision maker assigns customers to the vehicles checking the feasibility of the constructed routes (vehicle capacity constraints) and without taking into account the sequence by which the vehicles will visit the customers. In the second level, the decision maker finds the optimal routes of these assignments. The decision maker of the first level, once the cost of each routing has been calculated in the second level, estimates which assignment is the better one to choose. Based on this formulation, a bilevel genetic algorithm is proposed. In the first level of the proposed algorithm, a genetic algorithm is used for calculating the population of the most promising assignments of customers to vehicles. In the second level of the proposed algorithm, a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is solved, independently for each member of the population and for each assignment to vehicles. The algorithm was tested on two sets of benchmark instances and gave very satisfactory results. In both sets of instances the average quality is less than 1%. More specifically in the set with the 14 classic instances proposed by Christofides, the quality is 0.479% and in the second set with the 20 large scale vehicle routing problems, the quality is 0.826%. The algorithm is ranked in the tenth place among the 36 most known and effective algorithms in the literature for the first set of instances and in the sixth place among the 16 algorithms for the second set of instances. The computational time of the algorithm is decreased significantly compared to other heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms due to the fact that the Expanding Neighborhood Search Strategy is used.","2007-08","2024-04-22 16:49:33","2024-04-22 16:49:33","","555-580","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000247471100004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to propose an Artificial Ant Colony based on 2_Opt local search (AAC_2_Opt) to solve the DVRP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its results with those of existing methods in the literature on the same tests problems. The AAC_2_Opt algorithm can efficiently optimize the routing problem and provide highly competitive solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a dispatching problem of the BET fleet is formulated as a capacitated electric vehicle routing problem (VRP) with pick-up and delivery. As the BET dispatching problem is NP-hard, the performance of existing approaches deteriorates in large instance problems, especially when the customers have different preferences and constraints. This article proposes a bi-level strategy that incorporates routing zone partitioning and metaheuristic-based vehicle routing to solve the large-scale BET dispatching problem, considering the delivery types, limited travel distances, and cargo payloads. We apply this strategy to a real-world fleet dispatching scenario with around 300 customer positions for pickups and drop-offs.

Hence, the LRP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which justifies the use of metaheuristic approaches whenever large-scale instances need to be solved. In this paper, we explore a realistic version of the LRP in which facilities of different capacities are considered, i.e., the manager has to consider not only the location but also the size of the facilities to open. In order to tackle this optimization problem, three mixed-integer linear formulations are proposed and compared. As expected, they have been proved to be cost- and time- inefficient.

The aim of this problem is to determine optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles that can renew their capacity at intermediate replenishment stations. Although this problem is often met in real-life scenarios of transportation logistics, it has not received much attention by researchers. Our proposed framework employs a combination of algorithmic blocks based on powerful metaheuristic methodologies designed to achieve a desirable intensification and diversification interplay. In the first step of the solution approach, the initial solution is obtained by a cost-saving construction heuristic. In the second step, the initial solution is improved by employing tabu search within the variable neighborhood search methodology.

At these low-level chains, one usually faces a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). In practice, however, due to the high cost of service in many cases, some customers are not selected to serve. Investment-related restrictions in many cases make it impossible to serve some of the potential customers. In such conditions, designing a supply chain network, including a location-allocation problem in the warehouse, Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) at the distribution level, and customer selection at the retail level in several periods of time, is considered. In this respect, in addition to certain methods that can be used in small sizes, metaheuristic algorithms have been used to solve large-scale models. With the aim of improving the performance, if not improving a few diversifications, algorithms are temporarily enhanced; eventually, by using statistical approaches, it has been demonstrated that this method could have a significant impact on the quality of responses. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm have been used for this purpose. (C) 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

The energy consumption in BEVs plays an important role in determining their range coverage and the frequency of recharging. This paper introduces a new robust mathematical model for the EVRP with Heavy-duty Battery Electric Trucks to handle the energy consumption uncertainty in the short-haul delivery problems. Moreover, the on-time delivery factor that results in customers' satisfaction is addressed by minimizing the delay and the earliness during distribution. Hence, the presented EVRP is a bi-objective problem that simultaneously minimizes transportation costs and maximizes customers' satisfaction. To solve the problem, two metaheuristic algorithms are developed, including a Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) combined with multi-objective solution approaches (e.g., weighted-sum, epsilon-constraint, and hybrid methods). The results show that the ALNS algorithm combined with the weighted-sum method performed better than the other approaches. Moreover, a simulation study is conducted to analyze the robust solutions obtained for different levels of uncertainty to provide managerial insights for decision-makers.","2023-04","2024-04-22 16:50:08","2024-04-22 16:50:08","","","","","178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000990987200001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The location-routing problem (LRP) overcomes this drawback by simultaneously tackling location and routing decisions. This paper presents a cooperative metaheuristic to solve the LRP with capacitated routes and depots. The principle is to alternate between a depot location phase and a routing phase, exchanging information on the most promising edges. In the first phase, the routes and their customers are aggregated into supercustomers, leading to a facility-location problem, which is then solved by a Lagrangean relaxation of the assignment constraints. In the second phase, the routes from the resulting multidepot vehicle-routing problem (VRP) are improved using a granular tabu search (GTS) heuristic. At the end of each global iteration, information about the edges most often used is recorded to be used in the following phases. The method is evaluated on three sets of randomly generated instances and compared with other heuristics and a lower bound.

In order to tackle this problem, a new agent-based metaheuristic architecture is proposed to capture the uniqueness of vehicles by modelling them as agents while governing the search with centralised agent cooperation. This cooperation aims to generate near optimum routes by minimising the number of vehicles used, total travelled distance, and total waiting times. The innovative architecture encapsulates three individual core modules in a flexible metaheuristic implementation. First, the problem is modelled by an agent-based module that includes its components in representing, evaluating, and altering solutions. A second metaheuristic module is then designed and integrated, followed by a multi-objective module introduced to sort solutions generated by the metaheuristic module based on Pareto dominance. Tests on benchmark instances were run, resulting in better waiting times, with an average reduction of 2.21-time units, at the expense of the other objectives. Benchmark instances are modified to tackle the unique vehicle's problem by randomising locations, capacities, and operating shifts and tested to justify the proposed model's applicability.

The HVRPTW-LR arises when a limited number of resources, such as vehicles, drivers, instruments, and so on, are available but are insufficient to serve all customers in a route planning. Therefore, the route design involves the selection of customers to be visited at each route and resources to be used. Applications to this problem are found in real services companies with high seasonal demand which attend to different types of works and have to decide on how to effectively manage their resources. For designing optimal routes, a hierarchical objective function is considered, maximizing the total number of served customers as the primary objective, and minimizing the travel costs as secondary. A mathematical model of linear programming is introduced to describe and understand all constraints clearly. The problem is first heuristically solved by a semi-parallel insertion heuristic. Then, solutions are improved by a hybrid variable neighborhood descent metaheuristic based on a Tabu Search algorithm for the exploration of the neighborhood and a holding list. Experiments are conducted on numerous sets of benchmark instances from the literature to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has a good performance and can be easily applied for solving numerous vehicle routing problem variants from the literature.

The problem starting at the depot where the customer orders which associated with due date determined by customer, are released with different point of time. Ideally, to avoid any lateness in delivery process, the orders need to be delivered as soon as it released and available at the depot. However, this may increase the traveling cost because one vehicle needs to go and come back to depot for the other deliveries which this can be saved by batching the deliveries. Therefore, the study will focus on minimizing the tradeoff between traveling and tardiness costs. Literatures show that implementing the heuristic algorithms for solving various instances of VRPs manage to minimize the distribution cost within the reasonable computing times. An initial feasible solution was generated using a constructive heuristic.

However, mTSP in dynamic circumstances entails a greater complexity that recent approaches are still trying to grasp. Beyond time windows, capacity and other parameters that characterize the dynamics of each scenario, moving targets is one of the underdeveloped issues in the field of mTSP. The approach of this paper harnesses a simple prediction method to prove that integrating forecasting within a metaheuristic evolutionary-based method, such as genetic algorithms, can yield better results in a dynamic scenario than their simple non-predictive version. Real data is used from the retrieval of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) by tuna vessels in the Indian Ocean. Based on historical data registered by the GPS system of the buoys attached to the devices, their trajectory is firstly forecast to feed subsequently the functioning of a genetic algorithm that searches for the optimal route of tuna vessels in terms of total distance traveled. Thus, although valid for static cases and for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the main contribution of this method over existing literature lies in its application as a global search method to solve the multiple TSP with moving targets in many dynamic real-life optimization problems.","2018-11","2024-04-22 16:50:08","2024-04-22 16:50:08","","55-66","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000449133100005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The central problem is to design a set of routes to meet the demands of customers at minimum cost. However, in real life, it is necessary to take into account other objective functions, such as social functions, which consider, for example, the drivers' workload balance. This has led to growth in both the formulation of multiobjective models and exact and approximate solution techniques. In this article, to verify the quality of the results, first, a mathematical model is proposed that takes into account both economic and work balance objectives simultaneously and is solved using an exact method based on the decomposition approach. This method is used to compare the accuracy of the proposed approximate method in test cases of medium mathematical complexity. Second, an approximate method based on the Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic and Decomposition (ILS/D) is proposed to solve the biobjective Capacitated VRP (bi-CVRP) using test cases of medium and high mathematical complexity. Finally, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) approximate method is implemented to compare both medium- and high-complexity test cases with a benchmark.

In this paper, we show that the JOBPRP can be modelled as a clustered vehicle routing problem (CluVRP), a variant of the capacitated VRP in which customers are grouped into clusters. To solve this cluster-based model of the JOBPRP, we apply a two-level variable neighborhood search (2level-VNS) metaheuristic, previously developed for the CluVRP, and study which adaptations are required to perform efficiently in a warehouse environment. Additionally, we evaluate if the Hausdorff distance used as an approximation for the clusters' proximity in the CluVRP, performs equally well when determining closeness between pick orders in a warehouse. We compare the performance of the Hausdorff-based batching criterion to the cumulative minimal aisles visited-criterion, known as a well-performing batching metric in rectangular warehouses with parallel aisles. The 2level-VNS performs well compared to state-of-the-art algorithms specifically developed for the order batching problem (OBP) in a single-block warehouse. A multi-start VNS remains slightly superior to our approach. Concerning the Hausdorff distance, we conclude that in most experiments, the minimum-aisles criterion retains a better fit in the warehouse context. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective iterated local search algorithm for the VRPB. Its main component is an oscillating local search heuristic that has two main features. First, it explores a broad neighborhood structure at each iteration. This is efficiently done using a data structure that stores information about the set of neighboring solutions. Second, the heuristic performs constant transitions between feasible and infeasible portions of the solution space. These transitions are regulated by a dynamic adjustment of the penalty applied to infeasible solutions. An extensive statistical analysis was carried out in order to identify the most important components of the algorithm and to properly tune the values of their parameters. The results of the computational experiments carried out show that this algorithm is very competitive in comparison to the best metaheuristic algorithms for the VRPB. Additionally, new best solutions have been found for two instances in one of the benchmark sets. These results show that the performance of existing metaheuristic algorithms can be considerably improved by carrying out a thorough statistical analysis of their components. In particular, it shows that by expanding the exploration area and improving the efficiency of the local search heuristic, it is possible to develop simpler and faster metaheuristic algorithms without compromising the quality of the solutions obtained.

Since vehicle routing problem is an NP-difficult task, the problem can be solved by approximation algorithms. Metaheuristics give a ""good"" result within an ""acceptable"" time. When developing a new metaheuristic algorithm, researchers usually use only their intuition and test results to verify the efficiency of the algorithm, comparing it to the efficiency of other algorithms. However, it may also be necessary to analyze the search operators of the algorithms for deeper investigation. The fitness landscape is a tool for that purpose, describing the possible states of the search space, the neighborhood operator, and the fitness function. The goal of fitness landscape analysis is to measure the complexity and efficiency of the applicable operators. The paper aims to investigate the fitness landscape of a complex vehicle routing problem. The efficiency of the following operators is investigated: 2-opt, order crossover, partially matched crossover, cycle crossover. The results show that the most efficient one is the 2-opt operator. Based on the results of fitness landscape analysis, we propose a novel traveling salesman problem genetic algorithm optimization variant where the edges are the elementary units having a fitness value. The optimal route is constructed from the edges having good fitness value. The fitness value of an edge depends on the quality of the container routes. Based on the performed comparison tests, the proposed method significantly dominates many other optimization approaches.","2020-11","2024-04-22 16:50:09","2024-04-22 16:50:09","","","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000594676500001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This surge calls for novel strategies to optimize vehicle utilization while maintaining timely delivery. In response, many online retailers are incentivizing customers to embrace delayed home deliveries by offering economic incentives. Nonetheless, current transportation systems fall short in accommodating orders with extended delivery windows, primarily adhering to the First-In-First-Out rule and distance minimization via the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). In this paper, we introduce a new consolidation-based delivery methodology that addresses these challenges. Our approach accounts for orders with daily-based time windows and also anticipates future demand realizations (i.e., expected incoming orders). We characterize this consolidation problem using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and propose a custom metaheuristic approach that can tackle the problem on a large-scale setting, introducing a significant novelty approach in last-mile delivery research. We applied our methodology to one of Mexico's largest retailers and compared its performance against the company's existing transportation systems. Our approach substantially improves vehicle utilization and yields considerable reductions in distance traveled, time, and overall transportation costs, achieving cost savings of up to 52%. These savings represent tangible benefits, enabling potential revenue enhancements for businesses and cost-effective, timely deliveries for consumers. Additionally, the increased vehicle utilization implies fewer vehicles are needed for the same volume of deliveries, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. This innovative approach, therefore, presents a practical and highly effective solution for managing large-scale last-mile delivery scenarios.","2024-01","2024-04-22 16:50:09","2024-04-22 16:50:09","","","","","235","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001066372400001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The HCSPSPDTW is a bi-objective problem where the traveled time and distance should be minimized. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach for solving the HCSPSPDTW: the inner optimization problem solved by the k-means++ clustering algorithm, asks for finding the closest visits in terms of distance to avoid long travels. The outer problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) modeled by a mixed-integer mathematical model and solved using Tabu Search (TS) metaheuristic. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, this study used some modified test problems from Solomon's benchmark. The obtained results show that the proposed approach was able to generate better solutions than similar algorithms while using less computation time. For instance, the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms by generating less routing cost for 83.93% instances, less used vehicles for 98.73% instances, and by spending less computational time for 98.7% instances. The proposed HCSPSPDTW solving approach is the solver module of a decision support system that will help Home Health Care companies to make appropriate decisions on scheduling their daily plans which will lead to can lead to a significant reduction of transportation costs and improvement of staff satisfaction.

In modern societies, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is an important part of SCs, the main problem of MSWM is the cost that it generates and must be reduced. To solve this situation in this paper are considered two sub-models. The first sub-model uses vehicle routing problem (VRP) for routing fleet among generation waste to separation facilities. The second sub-model is designed to allocate resources from separation facilities to set of recovery plants or landfill centers. From the best of our knowledge, most of the past studies related to this topic have focused only on deterministic implementations. Also, recent studies usually focus on uncertain parameters in the area of waste generation. In addition, a few related studies have developed the uncertain parameter which has focused on facilitating separation. This study considers the uncertain parameters in the output rate of separation facilities as well as the importance of value recovery from each bin; the aim is to enhance the efficiency of operations. The purpose of this study is to minimize the total transportation cost and to maximize recycled revenue. Chance-constrained programming has been used to deal with stochastic optimization model. Four metaheuristic algorithms are employed to identify the best solution. Besides, the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated.

An optimum design of the pharmaceutical supply chain is critical to avoid economic damage and adverse effects on human health. The vehicle-routing problem, focused on finding the lowest-cost routes with available vehicles and constraints, such as time constraints and road length, is an important aspect of this. In this paper, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for a pharmaceutical company in Turkey is discussed. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model based on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is presented, aiming to minimize the total route cost with certain constraints. As the model provides an optimum solution for small problem sizes with the GUROBI (R) solver, for large problem sizes, metaheuristic methods that simulate annealing and adaptive large neighborhood search algorithms are proposed. A real dataset was used to analyze the effectiveness of the metaheuristic algorithms. The proposed simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) were evaluated and compared against GUROBI (R) and each other through a set of real problem instances. Findings The model is solved optimally for a small-sized dataset with exact algorithms; for solving a larger dataset, however, metaheuristic algorithms require significantly lesser time. For the problem addressed in this study, while the metaheuristic algorithms obtained the optimum solution in less than one minute, the solution in the GUROBI (R) solver was limited to one hour and three hours, and no solution could be obtained in this time interval.

Every vehicle's travel miles (route time) after charging is limited, thus the vehicle must be recharged after taking several trips and the minimal charging time (fueling time) must be satisfied. A multiple ant colony algorithm (ACA) was presented to solve VSPRFTC based on ACA used to solve traveling salesman problem (TSP), a new metaheuristic approach inspired by the foraging behavior of real colonies of ants. The VSPRFTC considered in this paper minimizes a multiple, hierarchical objective function: the first objective is to minimize the number of tours (or vehicles) and the second is to minimize the total deadhead time. New improvement of ACA as well as detailed operating steps was provided on the basis of former algorithm. Then in order to settle contradiction between accelerating convergence and avoiding prematurity or stagnation, improvement on route construction rule and Pheromone updating rule was adopted. A group feasible trip sets (blocks) had been produced after the process of applying ACA. In dealing with the fueling time constraint a bipartite graphic model and its optimization algorithm are developed for trip set connecting in a hub and spoke network system to minimize the number of vehicle required. The maximum matching of the bipartite graph is obtained by calculating the maximum inflow with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. At last, an example was analyzed to demonstrate the correctness of the application of this algorithm. It proved to be more efficient and robust in solving this problem. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The problem consists in defining a minimum cost set of routes for a fleet of vehicles that meets the demands of products for a set of suppliers and customers. The vehicles leave a single Cross-Dock (CD) towards the suppliers, pick up products and return to the CD, where products can be exchanged before being delivered to their customers. The vehicle routes must respect the vehicle capacity constraints, as well as the time window constraints. We adapted a constructive heuristic and six local search procedures from the literature of VRP, and made them efficient in the presence of the synchronization constraints of VRPCD. Besides, we propose three Iterated Local Search (Lourenco et al., 2010) heuristics for VRPCD. The first heuristic is a standard implementation of ILS, while the second extends the classic ILS framework by keeping a set of elite solutions, instead of a single current solution. The latter set is used in a restart procedure. As far as we can tell, this is the first ILS heuristic in the literature that keeps a population of current elite solutions. The third heuristic is an extension of the second that relies on an intensification procedure based on an Integer Programming formulation for the Set Partitioning problem. The latter allows a neighborhood with an exponential number of neighbors to be efficiently evaluated. We report computational results and comparisons with the best heuristics in the literature. Besides, we also present a new set with the largest instances in the literature of VRPCD, in order to demonstrate that the improvements we propose for the ILS metaheuristic are efficient even for large size instances. Results show that the best of our heuristics is competitive with the best heuristics in the literature of VRPCD. Besides, it improved the best solution known for half of the benchmark instances in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is possible with the integration of excellent solvers to software engineering methodologies that provide optimization-based decision support for planning. Since the logistics market is growing rapidly, the optimization of routing systems is of primary concern that motivates the use of vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers as software components integrated as an optimization engine. A critical success factor of routing optimization is quality vs. response time performance. Less time-consuming and more efficient automated processes can be achieved by employing stronger solution algorithms. This study aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) which is a popular extension of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem arising in real world applications where pickup and delivery operations are simultaneously taken into account to satisfy the vehicle capacity constraint with the objective of total travelled distance minimization. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on an ant colony system (ACS) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for its solution. VNS is a powerful optimization algorithm that provides intensive local search. However, it lacks a memory structure. This weakness can be minimized by utilizing long term memory structure of ACS and hence the overall performance of the algorithm can be boosted. In the proposed algorithm, instead of ants, VNS releases pheromones on the edges while ants provide a perturbation mechanism for the integrated algorithm using the pheromone information in order to explore search space further and jump from local optima. The performance of the proposed ACS empowered VNS algorithm is studied on well-known benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature of VRPSPD for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm that the developed approach is robust and very efficient in terms of both solution quality and CPU time since better results provided in a shorter time on benchmark data sets is a good performance indicator.

The objective of CVRP is to decide the routes for a set of vehicles to serve a set of demand points while minimizing the total routing cost. SOS is a simple and powerful metaheuristic that simulates the symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by an organism for surviving in an ecosystem. As SOS is originally developed for solving continuous optimization problems, we therefore apply two solution representations, SR-1 and SR-2, to transform SOS into an applicable solution approach for CVRP and then apply a local search strategy to improve the solution quality of SOS. The original SOS uses three interaction strategies, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, to improve a candidate solution. In this improved version, we propose two new interaction strategies, namely competition and amensalism. We develop six versions of SOS for solving CVRP. The first version, SOSCanonical, utilizes a commonly used continuous to discrete solution representation transformation procedure. The second version is an improvement of canonical SOS with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSBasic. The third and fourth versions use SR-1 and SR-2 with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The fifth and sixth versions, denoted as ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2, improve the implementation of SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2 by adding the newly proposed competition and amensalism interaction strategies. The performances of SOSCanonical, SOSBasic, SOSSR-1, and SOSSR-2 are evaluated on two sets of benchmark problems. First, the results of the four versions of SOS are compared, showing that the preferable result was obtained from SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2 . The performances of SOSSR-1, SOSSR-2, ISOSSR-1, and ISOSSR-2 are then compared, presenting that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 offer a better performance. Next, the ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 results are compared to the best-known solutions. The results show that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 produce good VRP solutions under a reasonable computational time, indicating that each of them is a good alternative algorithm for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem.

A general mixed integer programming model is employed to minimize the routing cost due to: the cost of vehicles and the travel cost of vehicles. A parallel Simulated Annealing (p-SA) algorithm that includes a Residual Capacity and Radial Surcharge (CRS) insertion-based heuristic is developed and applied to solve this NP-hard optimization problem. Computational results are reported for 65 test problems from Wang and Chen's benchmark and compared with the results from a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that minimizes the number of vehicles (NV) as the primary objective. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the p-SA algorithm, which is able to achieve the same objective response as 100% of the Wang and Chen small-scale benchmarks (number of customers from 10 to 50). For the Wang and Chen medium-scale benchmarks (number of 100 customers), the p-SA algorithm obtains better NV solutions for 12 instances and the same NV solutions for the remaining 44 instances. For the 44 instances with the same NV solutions, a secondary objective, travel distance (TD), the p-SA provides better solutions than the GA for 16 instances, and equal solutions for 7 instances. In addition, solutions are found for 30 large-scale instances, with customers of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000, which may serve as a new benchmark for the VRPSPDTW problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
